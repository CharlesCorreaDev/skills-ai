# Scrollspy

Automatically update Bootstrap navigation or list group components based on scroll position to indicate which link is currently active in the viewport.

## How it works

Scrollspy has a few requirements to function properly:

- If you’re building our JavaScript from source, it [requires `util.js`](getting-started__javascript.md#util).
- It must be used on a Bootstrap [nav component](components__navs.md) or [list group](components__list-group.md).
- Scrollspy requires `position: relative;` on the element you’re spying on, usually the `<body>`.
- When spying on elements other than the `<body>`, be sure to have a `height` set and `overflow-y: scroll;` applied.
- Anchors (`<a>`) are required and must point to an element with that `id`.

When successfully implemented, your nav or list group will update accordingly, moving the `.active` class from one item to the next based on their associated targets.

## Example in navbar

Scroll the area below the navbar and watch the active class change. The dropdown items will be highlighted as well.

#### @fat

Placeholder content for the scrollspy example. You got the finest architecture. Passport stamps, she's cosmopolitan. Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock. Never planned that one day I'd be losing you. She eats your heart out. Your kiss is cosmic, every move is magic. I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one. Greetings loved ones let's take a journey. Just own the night like the 4th of July! But you'd rather get wasted.

#### @mdo

Placeholder content for the scrollspy example. 'Cause she's the muse and the artist. (This is how we do) So you wanna play with magic. So just be sure before you give it all to me. I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight). Skip the talk, heard it all, time to walk the walk.

#### one

Placeholder content for the scrollspy example. Takes you miles high, so high, 'cause she’s got that one international smile. There's a stranger in my bed, there's a pounding in my head. Oh, no. In another life I would make you stay. ‘Cause I, I’m capable of anything. Suiting up for my crowning battle. Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof. Tone, tan fit and ready, turn it up cause its gettin' heavy. Her love is like a drug. I guess that I forgot I had a choice.

#### two

Placeholder content for the scrollspy example. It's time to bring out the big balloons. I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight). Yeah, we maxed our credit cards and got kicked out of the bar. Yo, shout out to all you kids, buying bottle service, with your rent money. I'm ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans. If you get the chance you better keep her. Yo, shout out to all you kids, buying bottle service, with your rent money.

#### three

Placeholder content for the scrollspy example. If you wanna dance, if you want it all, you know that I'm the girl that you should call. Walk through the storm I would. So let me get you in your birthday suit. The one that got away. Last Friday night, yeah I think we broke the law, always say we're gonna stop. 'Cause she's a little bit of Yoko, And she's a little bit of 'Oh no'. I want the jaw droppin', eye poppin', head turnin', body shockin'. Yeah, we maxed our credit cards and got kicked out of the bar.

And some more placeholder content, for good measure.

```
<nav id="navbar-example2" class="navbar navbar-light bg-light">
  <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Navbar</a>
  <ul class="nav nav-pills">
    <li class="nav-item">
      <a class="nav-link" href="#fat">@fat</a>
    </li>
    <li class="nav-item">
      <a class="nav-link" href="#mdo">@mdo</a>
    </li>
    <li class="nav-item dropdown">
      <a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="#" role="button" aria-expanded="false">Dropdown</a>
      <div class="dropdown-menu">
        <a class="dropdown-item" href="#one">one</a>
        <a class="dropdown-item" href="#two">two</a>
        <div role="separator" class="dropdown-divider"></div>
        <a class="dropdown-item" href="#three">three</a>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ul>
</nav>
<div data-spy="scroll" data-target="#navbar-example2" data-offset="0">
  <h4 id="fat">@fat</h4>
  <p>...</p>
  <h4 id="mdo">@mdo</h4>
  <p>...</p>
  <h4 id="one">one</h4>
  <p>...</p>
  <h4 id="two">two</h4>
  <p>...</p>
  <h4 id="three">three</h4>
  <p>...</p>
</div>
```

## Example with nested nav

Scrollspy also works with nested `.nav`s. If a nested `.nav` is `.active`, its parents will also be `.active`. Scroll the area next to the navbar and watch the active class change.

Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof. Tone, tan fit and ready, turn it up cause its gettin' heavy. Her love is like a drug. I guess that I forgot I had a choice.

  <a class="list-group-item list-group-item-action" href="#list-item-1">Item 1</a>
  <a class="list-group-item list-group-item-action" href="#list-item-2">Item 2</a>

  <h4 id="list-item-1">Item 1</h4>
  <p>...</p>
  <h4 id="list-item-2">Item 2</h4>

  <h4 id="list-item-4">Item 4</h4>
  <p>...</p>
</div>
```

## Usage

### Via data attributes

To easily add scrollspy behavior to your topbar navigation, add `data-spy="scroll"` to the element you want to spy on (most typically this would be the `<body>`). Then add the `data-target` attribute with the ID or class of the parent element of any Bootstrap `.nav` component.

```
body {
  position: relative;
}
```

```
<body data-spy="scroll" data-target="#navbar-example">
  ...
  <div id="navbar-example">
    <ul class="nav nav-tabs" role="tablist">
      ...
    </ul>
  </div>
  ...
</body>
```

### Via JavaScript

After adding `position: relative;` in your CSS, call the scrollspy via JavaScript:

```
$('body').scrollspy({ target: '#navbar-example' })
```

#### Resolvable ID targets required

Navbar links must have resolvable id targets. For example, a `<a href="#home">home</a>` must correspond to something in the DOM like `<div id="home"></div>`.

#### Non-`:visible` target elements ignored

Target elements that are not [`:visible` according to jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/) will be ignored and their corresponding nav items will never be highlighted.

### Methods

#### `.scrollspy('refresh')`

When using scrollspy in conjunction with adding or removing of elements from the DOM, you’ll need to call the refresh method like so:

```
$('[data-spy="scroll"]').each(function () {
  var $spy = $(this).scrollspy('refresh')
})
```

#### `.scrollspy('dispose')`

Destroys an element’s scrollspy.

### Options

Options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. For data attributes, append the option name to `data-`, as in `data-offset=""`.

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| offset | number | 10 | Pixels to offset from top when calculating position of scroll. |
| method | string | auto | Finds which section the spied element is in. `auto` will choose the best method to get scroll coordinates. `offset` will use jQuery offset method to get scroll coordinates. `position` will use jQuery position method to get scroll coordinates. |
| target | string | jQuery object | DOM element |  | Specifies element to apply Scrollspy plugin. |

### Events

| Event Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| activate.bs.scrollspy | This event fires on the scroll element whenever a new item becomes activated by the scrollspy. |

```
$('[data-spy="scroll"]').on('activate.bs.scrollspy', function () {
  // do something...
})
```
