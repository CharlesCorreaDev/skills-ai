| .-invisible | *Not found* |

Set the `visibility` of elements with our visibility utilities. These utility classes do not modify the `display` value at all and do not affect layout – `.invisible` elements still take up space in the page.

Elements with the `.invisible` class will be hidden *both* visually and for assistive technology/screen reader users.

Apply `.visible` or `.invisible` as needed.

HTML

```
          <div class="visible">...</div>
<div class="invisible">...</div>
```

SCSS

```
          // Class
.visible {
  visibility: visible;
}
.invisible {
  visibility: hidden;
}
```

### Sass utilities API

Visibility utilities are declared in our utilities API in `scss/_utilities.scss`. [Learn how to use the utilities API.](utilities__api.md#using-the-api)

"visibility": (
  property: visibility,
  class: null,
  values: (
    visible: visible,
    invisible: hidden,
  )
),
