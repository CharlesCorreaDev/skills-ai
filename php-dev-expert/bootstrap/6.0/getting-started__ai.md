##### On this page

Bootstrap ships resources built for large language models and AI-powered coding tools: machine-readable documentation you can feed to an LLM, and a set of agent skills that walk agents through common Bootstrap tasks step by step.

## LLM-ready docs

Our docs are available in a machine-readable format, following the [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) convention.

| File | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `llms.txt` | A curated index of every documentation page with links and descriptions. | [/llms.txt](https://getbootstrap.com/llms.txt) |
| `llms-full.txt` | The full text of the documentation concatenated into a single file for direct ingestion. | [/llms-full.txt](https://getbootstrap.com/llms-full.txt) |

## Skills

Install every Bootstrap skill into your coding agent:

Shell

```
          npx skills add twbs/bootstrap
```

The Skills CLI copies each `SKILL.md` from our repository into your agent. [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) lists the package after people run that command. There is no submit form.

Bootstrap also ships the same [agent skills](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/main/skills) in the `skills/` directory of our repository. Each skill is a focused, step-by-step playbook for one Bootstrap task, from migrating a project or setting up a new build to authoring a component and customizing our color system.

To use one without the CLI, point your agent at the relevant `SKILL.md` file and describe what you want to do. The skill’s `description` field tells the agent when it applies, and its steps keep the agent aligned with our official guidance. Always review an agent’s changes against the matching documentation.
