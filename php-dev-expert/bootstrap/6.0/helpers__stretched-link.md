# Stretched link

Make any HTML element or Bootstrap component clickable by “stretching” a nested link via CSS.

Add `.stretched-link` to a link to make its [containing block](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_block) clickable via a `::after` pseudo element. In most cases, this means that an element with `position: relative;` that contains a link with the `.stretched-link` class is clickable. Please note given [how CSS `position` works](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#propdef-position), `.stretched-link` cannot be mixed with most table elements.

Cards have `position: relative` by default in Bootstrap, so in this case you can safely add the `.stretched-link` class to a link in the card without any other HTML changes.

Multiple links and tap targets are not recommended with stretched links. However, some `position` and `z-index` styles can help should this be required.

Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card’s content.

HTML

```
<div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
  <img src="..." class="card-img-top" alt="...">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Card with stretched link</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card’s content.</p>
    <a href="#" class="btn-solid theme-primary stretched-link">Go somewhere</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

Most custom components do not have `position: relative` by default, so we need to add the `.position-relative` here to prevent the link from stretching outside the parent element.

##### Custom component with stretched link

This is some placeholder content for the custom component. It is intended to mimic what some real-world content would look like, and we’re using it here to give the component a bit of body and size.

HTML

```
<div class="d-flex position-relative">
  <img src="..." class="flex-shrink-0 me-3" alt="...">
  <div>
    <h5 class="mt-0">Custom component with stretched link</h5>
    <p>This is some placeholder content for the custom component. It is intended to mimic what some real-world content would look like, and we’re using it here to give the component a bit of body and size.</p>
    <a href="#" class="stretched-link">Go somewhere</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

##### Columns with stretched link

Another instance of placeholder content for this other custom component. It is intended to mimic what some real-world content would look like, and we’re using it here to give the component a bit of body and size.

HTML

```
<div class="row g-0 bg-1 position-relative">
  <div class="md:col-6 md:mb-0 md:p-4">
    <img src="..." class="w-100" alt="...">
  </div>
  <div class="md:col-6 p-4 md:ps-0">
    <h5 class="mt-0">Columns with stretched link</h5>
    <p>Another instance of placeholder content for this other custom component. It is intended to mimic what some real-world content would look like, and we’re using it here to give the component a bit of body and size.</p>
    <a href="#" class="stretched-link">Go somewhere</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Identifying the containing block

If the stretched link doesn’t seem to work, the [containing block](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_block#Identifying_the_containing_block) will probably be the cause. The following CSS properties will make an element the containing block:

- A `position` value other than `static`
- A `transform` or `perspective` value other than `none`
- A `will-change` value of `transform` or `perspective`
- A `filter` value other than `none` or a `will-change` value of `filter` (only works on Firefox)

##### Card with stretched links

Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card’s content.

[Stretched link will not work here, because `position: relative` is added to the link](#)

This [stretched link](#) will only be spread over the `p`-tag, because a transform is applied to it.

HTML

```
<div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
  <img src="..." class="card-img-top" alt="...">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Card with stretched links</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card’s content.</p>
    <p class="card-text">
      <a href="#" class="stretched-link fg-danger" style="position: relative;">Stretched link will not work here, because <code>position: relative</code> is added to the link</a>
    </p>
    <p class="card-text bg-1" style="transform: rotate(0);">
      This <a href="#" class="fg-warning stretched-link">stretched link</a> will only be spread over the <code>p</code>-tag, because a transform is applied to it.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```

## CSS

### Variables

Stretched links use local CSS variables on `.stretched-link` for real-time customization. Values for the CSS variables are generated from Sass maps unique to each component and applied to the aforementioned class.

[scss/helpers/\_stretched-link.scss](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v6.0.0-alpha.1/scss/helpers/_stretched-link.scss)

```
// stylelint-disable-next-line scss/dollar-variable-default
$stretched-link-tokens: defaults(
  (
    --stretched-link-z-index: 1,
  ),
  $stretched-link-tokens
);
```

### Sass variable

The pseudo-element used to stretch the link defaults to `after` and can be changed via the `$stretched-link-pseudo-element` Sass variable. This can’t be a CSS variable since it’s compiled directly into the generated selector.

[scss/helpers/\_stretched-link.scss](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v6.0.0-alpha.1/scss/helpers/_stretched-link.scss)

```
$stretched-link-pseudo-element: after;
```
