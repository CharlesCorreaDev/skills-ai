## Core concepts

- **Breakpoints are the building blocks of responsive design.** Use them to control when your layout can be adapted at a particular viewport or device size.
- **Use media queries to architect your CSS by breakpoint.** Media queries are a feature of CSS that allow you to conditionally apply styles based on a set of browser and operating system parameters. We most commonly use `min-width` in our media queries.
- **Mobile first, responsive design is the goal.** Bootstrap’s CSS aims to apply the bare minimum of styles to make a layout work at the smallest breakpoint, and then layers on styles to adjust that design for larger devices. This optimizes your CSS, improves rendering time, and provides a great experience for your visitors.

## Available breakpoints

Bootstrap includes six default breakpoints, sometimes referred to as *grid tiers*, for building responsively. These breakpoints can be customized if you’re using our source Sass files.

| Breakpoint | Class infix | Dimensions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Extra small | *None* | <576px |
| Small | `sm` | ≥576px |
| Medium | `md` | ≥768px |
| Large | `lg` | ≥1024px |
| Extra large | `xl` | ≥1280px |
| Extra extra large | `2xl` | ≥1536px |

Each breakpoint was chosen to comfortably hold containers whose widths are multiples of 12. Breakpoints are also representative of a subset of common device sizes and viewport dimensions—they don’t specifically target every use case or device. Instead, the ranges provide a strong and consistent foundation to build on for nearly any device.

These breakpoints are customizable via Sass—you’ll find them in a Sass map in our `_config.scss` stylesheet.

[scss/\_config.scss](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v6.0.0-alpha.1/scss/_config.scss)

```
$breakpoints: (
  xs: 0,
  sm: 576px,
  md: 768px,
  lg: 1024px,
  xl: 1280px,
  2xl: 1536px
);
```

## Media queries

Since Bootstrap is developed to be mobile first, we use a handful of [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries) to create sensible breakpoints for our layouts and interfaces. These breakpoints are mostly based on minimum viewport widths and allow us to scale up elements as the viewport changes.

### Min-width

Bootstrap primarily uses the following media query ranges—or breakpoints—in our source Sass files for our layout, grid system, and components.

SCSS

```
          // Source mixins

// No media query necessary for xs breakpoint as it’s effectively `@media (min-width: 0) { ... }`
@include media-breakpoint-up(sm) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-up(md) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-up(lg) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-up(xl) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-up(2xl) { ... }

// Usage

// Example: Hide starting at `min-width: 0`, and then show at the `sm` breakpoint
.custom-class {
  display: none;
}
@include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {
  .custom-class {
    display: block;
  }
}
```

These Sass mixins translate in our compiled CSS using the values declared in our Sass variables. For example:

SCSS

```
          // X-Small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)
// No media query for `xs` since this is the default in Bootstrap

// Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)
@media (width >= 576px) { ... }

// Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)
@media (width >= 768px) { ... }

// Large devices (desktops, 1024px and up)
@media (width >= 1024px) { ... }

// X-Large devices (large desktops, 1280px and up)
@media (width >= 1280px) { ... }

// XX-Large devices (larger desktops, 1536px and up)
@media (width >= 1536px) { ... }
```

### Max-width

We occasionally use media queries that go in the other direction (the given screen size *or smaller*):

SCSS

```
          // No media query necessary for xs breakpoint as it’s effectively `@media (max-width: 0) { ... }`
@include media-breakpoint-down(sm) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-down(md) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-down(lg) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-down(xl) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-down(2xl) { ... }

// Example: Style from medium breakpoint and down
@include media-breakpoint-down(md) {
  .custom-class {
    display: block;
  }
}
```

These mixins use the breakpoint values to create `max-width` media queries using modern range syntax. For example:

SCSS

```
          // `xs` returns only a ruleset and no media query
// ... { ... }

// `sm` applies to x-small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)
@media (width < 576px) { ... }

// `md` applies to small devices (landscape phones, less than 768px)
@media (width < 768px) { ... }

// `lg` applies to medium devices (tablets, less than 1024px)
@media (width < 1024px) { ... }

// `xl` applies to large devices (desktops, less than 1280px)
@media (width < 1280px) { ... }

// `2xl` applies to x-large devices (large desktops, less than 1536px)
@media (width < 1536px) { ... }
```

### Single breakpoint

There are also media queries and mixins for targeting a single segment of screen sizes using the minimum and maximum breakpoint widths.

SCSS

```
          @include media-breakpoint-only(xs) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-only(sm) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-only(md) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-only(lg) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-only(xl) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-only(2xl) { ... }
```

For example the `@include media-breakpoint-only(md) { ... }` will result in :

SCSS

```
          @media (width >= 768px) and (width < 1024px) { ... }
```

### Between breakpoints

Similarly, media queries may span multiple breakpoint widths:

SCSS

```
          @include media-breakpoint-between(md, xl) { ... }
```

Which results in:

SCSS

```
          // Example
// Apply styles starting from medium devices and up to extra large devices
@media (width >= 768px) and (width < 1280px) { ... }
```

## Container queries

In addition to viewport-based media queries, Bootstrap uses [container queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_containment/Container_queries) for certain components. Container queries allow elements to respond to the size of a parent element rather than the viewport, enabling more flexible and modular responsive behavior.

Container queries use the same breakpoint values as viewport media queries.

### Usage in Bootstrap

The following components use container queries:

- **[Navbar](components__navbar.md)** — Uses container queries for its responsive expand behavior. The `.navbar` element is set as a query container, and the `.*:navbar-expand` classes use `@container` queries instead of `@media` queries. This means the navbar responds to its own width rather than the viewport width, making it more adaptable when placed in different layout contexts (e.g., within a sidebar or constrained container).
- **[Stepper](components__stepper.md)** — The `.stepper-overflow` wrapper uses `container-type: inline-size` to establish a containment context for the horizontally scrolling stepper pattern.
- **[List group](components__list-group.md)** — The `.*:list-group-horizontal` classes use `@container` queries so the list group switches between vertical and horizontal layouts based on the width of its query container rather than the viewport.
- **[Card](components__card.md)** — The `.card-group` layout uses an `@container` query to attach cards into equal-width columns based on the width of its query container rather than the viewport.

Here’s how the navbar implements container queries:

SCSS

```
          // The navbar is defined as a query container
.navbar {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

// Responsive classes use container queries
.lg\:navbar-expand {
  @container (min-width: 1024px) {
    // Expanded navbar styles...
  }
}
```

### Setting a container

Use the `set-container()` mixin to establish an element as a query container:

SCSS

```
          // Default: inline-size containment
.my-component {
  @include set-container();
  // Output: container-type: inline-size;
}

// With explicit type
.my-component {
  @include set-container(size);
  // Output: container-type: size;
}

// With a name (uses shorthand property)
.my-component {
  @include set-container(inline-size, sidebar);
  // Output: container: sidebar / inline-size;
}
```

### Container query mixins

Similar to the `media-breakpoint-*` mixins for viewport-based media queries, Bootstrap provides container query mixins that use the same breakpoint values and range syntax.

#### Min-width

Use `container-breakpoint-up()` to apply styles when the container is at least the given breakpoint width:

SCSS

```
          .my-component {
  @include set-container();
}

.my-component-child {
  // …

  @include container-breakpoint-up(md) {
    // Styles for when container is at least 768px wide
  }

  @include container-breakpoint-up(lg) {
    // Styles for when container is at least 1024px wide
  }
}
```

These mixins use the same modern range syntax as media queries. For example:

SCSS

```
          @container (width >= 768px) { ... }
@container (width >= 1024px) { ... }
```

#### Max-width

Use `container-breakpoint-down()` to apply styles when the container is narrower than the given breakpoint:

SCSS

```
          // Sass usage
@include container-breakpoint-down(lg) { ... }

// Compiled CSS
@container (width < 1024px) { ... }
```

#### Single breakpoint

Use `container-breakpoint-only()` to target a single breakpoint range:

SCSS

```
          // Sass usage
@include container-breakpoint-only(md) { ... }

// Compiled CSS
@container (width >= 768px) and (width < 1024px) { ... }
```

#### Between breakpoints

Use `container-breakpoint-between()` to span multiple breakpoint widths:

SCSS

```
          // Sass usage
@include container-breakpoint-between(md, xl) { ... }

// Compiled CSS
@container (width >= 768px) and (width < 1280px) { ... }
```

### Named containers

All container query mixins accept an optional container name parameter for querying a specific ancestor container. This is useful when you have nested containers:

SCSS

```
          .sidebar {
  @include set-container(inline-size, sidebar);
}

.main-content {
  @include set-container(inline-size, main);
}

// Query the sidebar container specifically, even if nested inside main
.widget {
  @include container-breakpoint-up(md, sidebar) {
    // …
  }
}
```

The compiled output includes the container name:

SCSS

```
          @container sidebar (width >= 768px) { ... }
```
