[Download Sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/archive/v3.4.1.tar.gz)

## jsDelivr

The folks over at [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) graciously provide CDN support for Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript. Just use these [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) links.

```
<!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@3.4.1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-HSMxcRTRxnN+Bdg0JdbxYKrThecOKuH5zCYotlSAcp1+c8xmyTe9GYg1l9a69psu" crossorigin="anonymous">

<!-- Optional theme -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@3.4.1/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css" integrity="sha384-6pzBo3FDv/PJ8r2KRkGHifhEocL+1X2rVCTTkUfGk7/0pbek5mMa1upzvWbrUbOZ" crossorigin="anonymous">

<!-- Latest compiled and minified JavaScript -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@3.4.1/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-aJ21OjlMXNL5UyIl/XNwTMqvzeRMZH2w8c5cRVpzpU8Y5bApTppSuUkhZXN0VxHd" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

## Install with Bower

You can also install and manage Bootstrap's Less, CSS, JavaScript, and fonts using [Bower](https://bower.io/):

```
bower install bootstrap
```

## Install with npm

You can also install Bootstrap using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```
npm install bootstrap@3
```

`require('bootstrap')` will load all of Bootstrap's jQuery plugins onto the jQuery object. The `bootstrap` module itself does not export anything. You can manually load Bootstrap's jQuery plugins individually by loading the `/js/*.js` files under the package's top-level directory.

Bootstrap's `package.json` contains some additional metadata under the following keys:

- `less` - path to Bootstrap's main [Less](http://lesscss.org/) source file
- `style` - path to Bootstrap's non-minified CSS that's been precompiled using the default settings (no customization)

## Install with Composer

You can also install and manage Bootstrap's Less, CSS, JavaScript, and fonts using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```
composer require twbs/bootstrap
```

## Autoprefixer required for Less/Sass

Bootstrap uses [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to deal with [CSS vendor prefixes](https://www.lifewire.com/css-vendor-prefixes-3466867). If you're compiling Bootstrap from its Less/Sass source and not using our Gruntfile, you'll need to integrate Autoprefixer into your build process yourself. If you're using precompiled Bootstrap or using our Gruntfile, you don't need to worry about this because Autoprefixer is already integrated into our Gruntfile.

# What's included

Bootstrap is downloadable in two forms, within which you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common resources and providing both compiled and minified variations.

#### jQuery required

Please note that **all JavaScript plugins require jQuery** to be included, as shown in the [starter template](#template). [Consult our `bower.json`](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v3-dev/bower.json) to see which versions of jQuery are supported.

## Precompiled Bootstrap

Once downloaded, unzip the compressed folder to see the structure of (the compiled) Bootstrap. You'll see something like this:

```
bootstrap/
├── css/
│   ├── bootstrap.css
│   ├── bootstrap.css.map
│   ├── bootstrap.min.css
│   ├── bootstrap.min.css.map
│   ├── bootstrap-theme.css
│   ├── bootstrap-theme.css.map
│   ├── bootstrap-theme.min.css
│   └── bootstrap-theme.min.css.map
├── js/
│   ├── bootstrap.js
│   └── bootstrap.min.js
└── fonts/
    ├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot
    ├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg
    ├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf
    ├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff
    └── glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff2
```

This is the most basic form of Bootstrap: precompiled files for quick drop-in usage in nearly any web project. We provide compiled CSS and JS (`bootstrap.*`), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (`bootstrap.min.*`). CSS [source maps](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/source-maps) (`bootstrap.*.map`) are available for use with certain browsers' developer tools. Fonts from Glyphicons are included, as is the optional Bootstrap theme.

## Bootstrap source code

The Bootstrap source code download includes the precompiled CSS, JavaScript, and font assets, along with source Less, JavaScript, and documentation. More specifically, it includes the following and more:

```
bootstrap/
├── less/
├── js/
├── fonts/
├── dist/
│   ├── css/
│   ├── js/
│   └── fonts/
└── docs/
    └── examples/
```

The `less/`, `js/`, and `fonts/` are the source code for our CSS, JS, and icon fonts (respectively). The `dist/` folder includes everything listed in the precompiled download section above. The `docs/` folder includes the source code for our documentation, and `examples/` of Bootstrap usage. Beyond that, any other included file provides support for packages, license information, and development.

# Compiling CSS and JavaScript

Bootstrap uses [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) for its build system, with convenient methods for working with the framework. It's how we compile our code, run tests, and more.

## Installing Grunt

To install Grunt, you must **first [download and install node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/)** (which includes npm). npm stands for [node packaged modules](https://www.npmjs.com/) and is a way to manage development dependencies through node.js.

Then, from the command line:

1. Install `grunt-cli` globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
2. Navigate to the root `/bootstrap/` directory, then run `npm install`. npm will look at the [`package.json`](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v3-dev/package.json) file and automatically install the necessary local dependencies listed there.

When completed, you'll be able to run the various Grunt commands provided from the command line.

## Available Grunt commands

### `grunt dist` (Just compile CSS and JavaScript)

Regenerates the `/dist/` directory with compiled and minified CSS and JavaScript files. As a Bootstrap user, this is normally the command you want.

### `grunt watch` (Watch)

Watches the Less source files and automatically recompiles them to CSS whenever you save a change.

### `grunt test` (Run tests)

Runs [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) and runs the [QUnit](https://qunitjs.com/) tests in real browsers thanks to [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/2.0/index.html).

### `grunt docs` (Build & test the docs assets)

Builds and tests CSS, JavaScript, and other assets which are used when running the documentation locally via `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

### `grunt` (Build absolutely everything and run tests)

Compiles and minifies CSS and JavaScript, builds the documentation website, runs the HTML5 validator against the docs, regenerates the Customizer assets, and more. Requires [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). Usually only necessary if you're hacking on Bootstrap itself.

## Troubleshooting

Should you encounter problems with installing dependencies or running Grunt commands, first delete the `/node_modules/` directory generated by npm. Then, rerun `npm install`.

# Basic template

Start with this basic HTML template, or modify [these examples](#examples). We hope you'll customize our templates and examples, adapting them to suit your needs.

Copy the HTML below to begin working with a minimal Bootstrap document.

```

    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

# Tools

## Bootlint

**[Bootlint](https://github.com/twbs/bootlint)** is the official Bootstrap HTML [linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) tool. It automatically checks for several common HTML mistakes in webpages that are using Bootstrap in a fairly "vanilla" way. Vanilla Bootstrap's components/widgets require their parts of the DOM to conform to certain structures. Bootlint checks that instances of Bootstrap components have correctly-structured HTML. Consider adding Bootlint to your Bootstrap web development toolchain so that none of the common mistakes slow down your project's development.

# Disabling responsiveness

Bootstrap automatically adapts your pages for various screen sizes.
Here's how to disable this feature so your page works like [this non-responsive example](examples__non-responsive.md).

## Steps to disable page responsiveness

1. Omit the viewport `<meta>` mentioned in [the CSS docs](css.md#overview-mobile)
2. Override the `width` on the `.container` for each grid tier with a single width, for example `width: 970px !important;` Be sure that this comes after the default Bootstrap CSS. You can optionally avoid the `!important` with media queries or some selector-fu.
3. If using navbars, remove all navbar collapsing and expanding behavior.
4. For grid layouts, use `.col-xs-*` classes in addition to, or in place of, the medium/large ones. Don't worry, the extra-small device grid scales to all resolutions.

You'll still need Respond.js for IE8 (since our media queries are still there and need to be processed).
This disables the "mobile site" aspects of Bootstrap.

## Bootstrap template with responsiveness disabled

We've applied these steps to an example. Read its source code to see the specific changes implemented.

#### Migrating from v2.x to v3.x

Looking to migrate from an older version of Bootstrap to v3.x? Check out [our migration guide](migration.md).

# Browser and device support

Bootstrap is built to work best in the latest desktop and mobile browsers, meaning older browsers might display differently styled, though fully functional, renderings of certain components.

## Supported browsers

Specifically, we support the **latest versions** of the following browsers and platforms.

Alternative browsers which use the latest version of WebKit, Blink, or Gecko, whether directly or via the platform's web view API, are not explicitly supported. However, Bootstrap should (in most cases) display and function correctly in these browsers as well. More specific support information is provided below.

### Mobile devices

Generally speaking, Bootstrap supports the latest versions of each major platform's default browsers. Note that proxy browsers (such as Opera Mini, Opera Mobile's Turbo mode, UC Browser Mini, Amazon Silk) are not supported.

|  | Chrome | Firefox | Safari |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Android | Supported | Supported | N/A |
| iOS | Supported | Supported | Supported |

### Desktop browsers

Similarly, the latest versions of most desktop browsers are supported.

|  | Chrome | Firefox | Internet Explorer | Opera | Safari |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mac | Supported | Supported | N/A | Supported | Supported |
| Windows | Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported | Not supported |

On Windows, **we support Internet Explorer 8-11**.

For Firefox, in addition to the latest normal stable release, we also support the latest [Extended Support Release (ESR)](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/) version of Firefox.

Unofficially, Bootstrap should look and behave well enough in Chromium and Chrome for Linux, Firefox for Linux, and Internet Explorer 7, as well as Microsoft Edge, though they are not officially supported.

For a list of some of the browser bugs that Bootstrap has to grapple with, see our [Wall of browser bugs](browser-bugs.md).

## Internet Explorer 8 and 9

Internet Explorer 8 and 9 are also supported, however, please be aware that some CSS3 properties and HTML5 elements are not fully supported by these browsers. In addition, **Internet Explorer 8 requires the use of [Respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) to enable media query support.**

| Feature | Internet Explorer 8 | Internet Explorer 9 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `border-radius` | Not supported | Supported |
| `box-shadow` | Not supported | Supported |
| `transform` | Not supported | Supported, with `-ms` prefix |
| `transition` | Not supported | |
| `placeholder` | Not supported | |

Visit [Can I use...](https://caniuse.com/) for details on browser support of CSS3 and HTML5 features.

## Internet Explorer 8 and Respond.js

Beware of the following caveats when using Respond.js in your development and production environments for Internet Explorer 8.

### Respond.js and cross-domain CSS

Using Respond.js with CSS hosted on a different (sub)domain (for example, on a CDN) requires some additional setup. [See the Respond.js docs](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond/blob/master/README.md#cdnx-domain-setup) for details.

### Respond.js and `file://`

Due to browser security rules, Respond.js doesn't work with pages viewed via the `file://` protocol (like when opening a local HTML file). To test responsive features in IE8, view your pages over HTTP(S). [See the Respond.js docs](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond/blob/master/README.md#support--caveats) for details.

### Respond.js and `@import`

Respond.js doesn't work with CSS that's referenced via `@import`. In particular, some Drupal configurations are known to use `@import`. [See the Respond.js docs](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond/blob/master/README.md#support--caveats) for details.

## Internet Explorer 8 and box-sizing

IE8 does not fully support `box-sizing: border-box;` when combined with `min-width`, `max-width`, `min-height`, or `max-height`. For that reason, as of v3.0.1, we no longer use `max-width` on `.container`s.

## Internet Explorer 8 and @font-face

IE8 has some issues with `@font-face` when combined with `:before`. Bootstrap uses that combination with its Glyphicons. If a page is cached, and loaded without the mouse over the window (i.e. hit the refresh button or load something in an iframe) then the page gets rendered before the font loads. Hovering over the page (body) will show some of the icons and hovering over the remaining icons will show those as well. [See issue #13863](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/13863) for details.

## IE Compatibility modes

Bootstrap is not supported in the old Internet Explorer compatibility modes. To be sure you're using the latest rendering mode for IE, consider including the appropriate `<meta>` tag in your pages:

```
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
```

Confirm the document mode by opening the debugging tools: press `F12` and check the "Document Mode".

This tag is included in all of Bootstrap's documentation and examples to ensure the best rendering possible in each supported version of Internet Explorer.

See [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6771258/what-does-meta-http-equiv-x-ua-compatible-content-ie-edge-do) for more information.

## Internet Explorer 10 in Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8

Internet Explorer 10 doesn't differentiate **device width** from **viewport width**, and thus doesn't properly apply the media queries in Bootstrap's CSS. Normally you'd just add a quick snippet of CSS to fix this:

```
@-ms-viewport       { width: device-width; }
```

However, this doesn't work for devices running Windows Phone 8 versions older than [Update 3 (a.k.a. GDR3)](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2013/10/14/introducing-windows-phone-preview-for-developers/), as it causes such devices to show a mostly desktop view instead of narrow "phone" view. To address this, you'll need to **include the following CSS and JavaScript to work around the bug**.

```
@-ms-viewport       { width: device-width; }
@-o-viewport        { width: device-width; }
@viewport           { width: device-width; }
```

```
// Copyright 2014-2019 Twitter, Inc.
// Licensed under MIT (https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v3-dev/LICENSE)
if (navigator.userAgent.match(/IEMobile\/10\.0/)) {
  var msViewportStyle = document.createElement('style')
  msViewportStyle.appendChild(
    document.createTextNode(
      '@-ms-viewport{width:auto!important}'
    )
  )
  document.querySelector('head').appendChild(msViewportStyle)
}
```

For more information and usage guidelines, read [Windows Phone 8 and Device-Width](https://timkadlec.com/2013/01/windows-phone-8-and-device-width/).

As a heads up, we include this in all of Bootstrap's documentation and examples as a demonstration.

## Safari percent rounding

The rendering engine of versions of Safari prior to v7.1 for OS X and Safari for iOS v8.0 had some trouble with the number of decimal places used in our `.col-*-1` grid classes. So if you had 12 individual grid columns, you'd notice that they came up short compared to other rows of columns. Besides upgrading Safari/iOS, you have some options for workarounds:

- Add `.pull-right` to your last grid column to get the hard-right alignment
- Tweak your percentages manually to get the perfect rounding for Safari (more difficult than the first option)

## Modals, navbars, and virtual keyboards

### Overflow and scrolling

Support for `overflow: hidden` on the `<body>` element is quite limited in iOS and Android. To that end, when you scroll past the top or bottom of a modal in either of those devices' browsers, the `<body>` content will begin to scroll. See [Chrome bug #175502](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=175502) (fixed in Chrome v40) and [WebKit bug #153852](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=153852).

### iOS text fields and scrolling

As of iOS 9.3, while a modal is open, if the initial touch of a scroll gesture is within the boundary of a textual `<input>` or a `<textarea>`, the `<body>` content underneath the modal will be scrolled instead of the modal itself. See [WebKit bug #153856](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=153856).

### Virtual keyboards

Also, note that if you're using a fixed navbar or using inputs within a modal, iOS has a rendering bug that doesn't update the position of fixed elements when the virtual keyboard is triggered. A few workarounds for this include transforming your elements to `position: absolute` or invoking a timer on focus to try to correct the positioning manually. This is not handled by Bootstrap, so it is up to you to decide which solution is best for your application.

### Navbar Dropdowns

The `.dropdown-backdrop` element isn't used on iOS in the nav because of the complexity of z-indexing. Thus, to close dropdowns in navbars, you must directly click the dropdown element (or [any other element which will fire a click event in iOS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/click#Safari_Mobile)).

## Browser zooming

Page zooming inevitably presents rendering artifacts in some components, both in Bootstrap and the rest of the web. Depending on the issue, we may be able to fix it (search first and then open an issue if need be). However, we tend to ignore these as they often have no direct solution other than hacky workarounds.

## Sticky `:hover`/`:focus` on mobile

Even though real hovering isn't possible on most touchscreens, most mobile browsers emulate hovering support and make `:hover` "sticky". In other words, `:hover` styles start applying after tapping an element and only stop applying after the user taps some other element. This can cause Bootstrap's `:hover` states to become undesirably "stuck" on such browsers. Some mobile browsers also make `:focus` similarly sticky. There is currently no simple workaround for these issues other than removing such styles entirely.

## Printing

Even in some modern browsers, printing can be quirky.

In particular, as of Chrome v32 and regardless of margin settings, Chrome uses a viewport width significantly narrower than the physical paper size when resolving media queries while printing a webpage. This can result in Bootstrap's extra-small grid being unexpectedly activated when printing. [See issue #12078](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/12078) and [Chrome bug #273306](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=273306) for some details. Suggested workarounds:

- Embrace the extra-small grid and make sure your page looks acceptable under it.
- Customize the values of the `@screen-*` Less variables so that your printer paper is considered larger than extra-small.
- Add custom media queries to change the grid size breakpoints for print media only.

Also, as of Safari v8.0, fixed-width `.container`s can cause Safari to use an unusually small font size when printing. See [#14868](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/14868) and [WebKit bug #138192](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138192) for more details. One potential workaround for this is adding the following CSS:

```
@media print {
  .container {
    width: auto;
  }
}
```

## Android stock browser

Out of the box, Android 4.1 (and even some newer releases apparently) ship with the Browser app as the default web browser of choice (as opposed to Chrome). Unfortunately, the Browser app has lots of bugs and inconsistencies with CSS in general.

### Select menus

On `<select>` elements, the Android stock browser will not display the side controls if there is a `border-radius` and/or `border` applied. (See [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14744437/html-select-box-not-showing-drop-down-arrow-on-android-version-4-0-when-set-with) for details.) Use the snippet of code below to remove the offending CSS and render the `<select>` as an unstyled element on the Android stock browser. The user agent sniffing avoids interference with Chrome, Safari, and Mozilla browsers.

```
<script>
$(function () {
  var nua = navigator.userAgent
  var isAndroid = (nua.indexOf('Mozilla/5.0') > -1 && nua.indexOf('Android ') > -1 && nua.indexOf('AppleWebKit') > -1 && nua.indexOf('Chrome') === -1)
  if (isAndroid) {
    $('select.form-control').removeClass('form-control').css('width', '100%')
  }
})
</script>
```

## Validators

In order to provide the best possible experience to old and buggy browsers, Bootstrap uses [CSS browser hacks](http://browserhacks.com) in several places to target special CSS to certain browser versions in order to work around bugs in the browsers themselves. These hacks understandably cause CSS validators to complain that they are invalid. In a couple places, we also use bleeding-edge CSS features that aren't yet fully standardized, but these are used purely for progressive enhancement.

These validation warnings don't matter in practice since the non-hacky portion of our CSS does fully validate and the hacky portions don't interfere with the proper functioning of the non-hacky portion, hence why we deliberately ignore these particular warnings.

Our HTML docs likewise have some trivial and inconsequential HTML validation warnings due to our inclusion of a workaround for [a certain Firefox bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=654072).

# Third party support

While we don't officially support any third party plugins or add-ons, we do offer some useful advice to help avoid potential issues in your projects.

## Box-sizing

Some third party software, including Google Maps and Google Custom Search Engine, conflict with Bootstrap due to `* { box-sizing: border-box; }`, a rule which makes it so `padding` does not affect the final computed width of an element. Learn more about [box model and sizing at CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/).

Depending on the context, you may override as-needed (Option 1) or reset the box-sizing for entire regions (Option 2).

```
/* Box-sizing resets
 *
 * Reset individual elements or override regions to avoid conflicts due to
 * global box model settings of Bootstrap. Two options, individual overrides and
 * region resets, are available as plain CSS and uncompiled Less formats.
 */

/* Option 1A: Override a single element's box model via CSS */
.element {
  -webkit-box-sizing: content-box;
     -moz-box-sizing: content-box;
          box-sizing: content-box;
}

/* Option 1B: Override a single element's box model by using a Bootstrap Less mixin */
.element {
  .box-sizing(content-box);
}

/* Option 2A: Reset an entire region via CSS */
.reset-box-sizing,
.reset-box-sizing *,
.reset-box-sizing *:before,
.reset-box-sizing *:after {
  -webkit-box-sizing: content-box;
     -moz-box-sizing: content-box;
          box-sizing: content-box;
}

/* Option 2B: Reset an entire region with a custom Less mixin */
.reset-box-sizing {
  &,
  *,
  *:before,
  *:after {
    .box-sizing(content-box);
  }
}
.element {
  .reset-box-sizing();
}
```

# Accessibility

Bootstrap follows common web standards and—with minimal extra effort—can be used to create sites that are accessible to those using AT.

## Skip navigation

If your navigation contains many links and comes before the main content in the DOM, add a `Skip to main content` link before the navigation (for a simple explanation, see this [A11Y Project article on skip navigation links](https://a11yproject.com/posts/skip-nav-links/)). Using the `.sr-only` class will visually hide the skip link, and the `.sr-only-focusable` class will ensure that the link becomes visible once focused (for sighted keyboard users).

Due to long-standing shortcomings/bugs in Chrome (see [issue 262171 in the Chromium bug tracker](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=262171 "Chromium bug tracker - Issue 262171: Focus should cycle from named anchor")) and Internet Explorer (see this article on [in-page links and focus order](http://accessibleculture.org/articles/2010/05/in-page-links/)), you will need to make sure that the target of your skip link is at least programmatically focusable by adding `tabindex="-1"`.

In addition, you may want to explicitly suppress a visible focus indication on the target (particularly as Chrome currently also sets focus on elements with `tabindex="-1"` when they are clicked with the mouse) with `#content:focus { outline: none; }`.

Note that this bug will also affect any other in-page links your site may be using, rendering them useless for keyboard users. You may consider adding a similar stop-gap fix to all other named anchors / fragment identifiers that act as link targets.

```
<body>
  <a href="#content" class="sr-only sr-only-focusable">Skip to main content</a>
  ...
  <div class="container" id="content" tabindex="-1">
    <!-- The main page content -->
  </div>
</body>
```

## Nested headings

When nesting headings (`<h1>` - `<h6>`), your primary document header should be an `<h1>`. Subsequent headings should make logical use of `<h2>` - `<h6>` such that screen readers can construct a table of contents for your pages.

Learn more at [HTML CodeSniffer](https://squizlabs.github.io/HTML_CodeSniffer/Standards/Section508/) and [Penn State's AccessAbility](http://accessibility.psu.edu/headings/).

## Color contrast

Currently, some of the default color combinations available in Bootstrap (such as the various [styled button](css.md#buttons) classes, some of the code highlighting colors used for [basic code blocks](css.md#code-block), the `.bg-primary` [contextual background](css.md#helper-classes-backgrounds) helper class, and the default link color when used on a white background) have a low contrast ratio (below the [recommended ratio of 4.5:1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast-contrast)). This can cause problems to users with low vision or who are color blind. These default colors may need to be modified to increase their contrast and legibility.

# End of Life

Get ongoing support, security fixes, and more with Bootstrap 4 thanks to Never-Ending Support from the folks at HeroDevs.

Bootstrap 3 was released over a decade ago in August 2013, and Bootstrap 4 over six years ago in January 2018. Since then, millions of people have learned Bootstrap, prototyped with it, and shipped some amazing sites and apps with it. While Bootstrap 5 is continuing that journey with developers all over the world, there are still tons of those teams living on an older version of Bootstrap with limited to no support. Until now.

Bootstrap 3 reached end of life July 24, 2019, followed by Bootstrap 4 on January 1, 2023. As such, neither version receives new features, updates, or security fixes. However, both are still available on all existing distribution channels (CDNs, package managers, GitHub, etc).

We strongly recommend folks start out on or [upgrade](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/migration/) to the [latest version of Bootstrap (v5.x)](https://getbootstrap.com/), but for those who can't upgrade just yet and have compliance or security requirements, we're introducing [Never-Ending Support for Bootstrap 3 and 4 with HeroDevs](https://www.herodevs.com/support/nes-bootstrap?utm_source=Bootstrap_site&utm_medium=Banner&utm_campaign=v3and4_eol).

[Purchase Bootstrap NES](https://www.herodevs.com/support/nes-bootstrap?utm_source=Bootstrap_site&utm_medium=Banner&utm_campaign=v3and4_eol)

## What's Next

Bootstrap 5 has been the default version of Bootstrap since May 5, 2021. Users who have migrated have enjoyed:

- **No Dependency on jQuery**

  Bootstrap 5 completely removes jQuery as a dependency, opting instead for vanilla JavaScript. This change was aimed at improving performance, reducing project file sizes, and catering to modern development environments where jQuery is less prevalent.
- **Enhanced Grid System**

  Bootstrap 5 further enhances the grid system with additional utility classes and improved customization options, making it even easier to create complex layouts. It also introduces the use of CSS custom properties (variables) for more dynamic styling.
- **Improved Customization**

  Bootstrap 5 focuses heavily on custom properties (CSS variables), which are easier to use and allow for real-time theme customization without the need to recompile Sass. This makes theme customization far more accessible and dynamic.
- **Updated Components and Utilities**

  Bootstrap 5 introduces new components (such as offcanvas menu for better mobile experiences) and updated existing components with new features and improved accessibility. It also expands Bootstraps utility API for spacing, typography, and color, providing more control over the design directly from the class attributes.
- **Improved Accessibility**

  Accessibility has been a focus of Bootstrap, with each version making strides in ensuring web content is accessible to all users. Bootstrap 5 emphasizes improvements in form controls, color contrast ratios, and keyboard navigation to meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards more closely.
- **Enhanced Performance and Best Practices**

  By removing jQuery and making other optimizations, Bootstrap 5 aims to improve loading times and performance for websites and applications. Version 5 also embraces best practices for responsive design, encouraging a more mobile-first approach to layouts and interactions.
- **Native Dark Mode Support**

  While not initially released with Bootstrap 5, subsequent updates have focused on native dark mode and custom color mode support, reflecting a growing trend in user interface design preferences.
- **…and more!**

  When and if you can, consider migrating!

## Still on Bootstrap 3 or 4?

We know that some folks aren't able to upgrade or fully migrate for one reason or another, so here are some other options to consider. Update to the Bootstrap 3 or 4 Final Release (v3.4.1 / v4.6.2)

The latest release of Bootstrap 3 (v3.4.1) and Bootstrap 4 (v4.6.2) were the final releases of these major versions and included security patches for XSS vulnerabilities (v3.x), bug fixes for enhanced stability, and updated documentation for better developer guidance.

These versions will be the starting point for extended support mentioned below.

## Purchase Extended Support for Bootstrap 3 and 4

If you have to stay on Bootstrap 3 and 4 post-EOL, we have partnered with HeroDevs to offer Never-Ending Support (NES). NES for Bootstrap 3 and 4 provides ongoing updates and security patches for both versions even after EOL so that applications with strict compliance requirements remain secure and compliant. It also guarantees that Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 applications will continue to operate effectively in modern browsers and maintain compatibility with essential libraries. Finally, Bootstrap NES has continuous security monitoring and a 14-day SLA for fixes.

Bootstrap NES is the continuation of the support you've enjoyed during the Bootstrap 3/4 LTS periods—but indefinitely. For more detailed information, visit the [HeroDevs Bootstrap NES page](https://www.herodevs.com/support/nes-bootstrap?utm_source=Bootstrap_site&utm_medium=Banner&utm_campaign=v3and4_eol).

## Notify Your Users of your Bootstrap 3/4 Post-EOL Plan

If you can't migrate to Bootstrap 5 or use Bootstrap NES at the moment but still remain on Bootstrap 3 or 4, you may need to consider how you will communicate your security plans to your customers.

This does not apply to all Bootstrap users, but many teams are prohibited from shipping unsupported software by SLAs, contracts and agreements, or other obligations to downstream parties. These could be with customers, compliance agencies, or even internal company departments. For an increasing number of industries, governing regulatory bodies are also raising expectations on what software creators are accountable for.

If you work with such business requirements, You may need to let yourcustomers, managers, CIO/CISO, or other relevant stakeholders know aboutyour plan to manage, support and address any potential CVEs. [While Bootstrap 3 and 4 haven't had any major vulnerabilities](https://security.snyk.io/package/npm/bootstrap) that have not received patches in later versions, CVEs do turn up for even the most mature EOL projects—whether directly or via compromised dependencies. Subscribing to CVE notifications through organizations like [OpenCVE](https://www.opencve.io/welcome) and [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) can be a good way to find out about vulnerabilities as soon as they're discovered. Browsers may also ship changes that break legacy libraries—this is rare, but it does happen.
