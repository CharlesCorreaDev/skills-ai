# Apache Module mod\_mime

### Summary

This module is used to associate various bits of "meta
information" with files by their filename extensions. This
information relates the filename of the document to its
mime-type, language, character set and encoding. This
information is sent to the browser, and participates in content
negotiation, so the user's preferences are respected when
choosing one of several possible files to serve. See
`mod_negotiation` for more information
about [content negotiation](content-negotiation.md).

The directives `AddCharset`, `AddEncoding`, `AddLanguage` and `AddType` are all used to map file
extensions onto the meta-information for that file. Respectively
they set the character set, content-encoding, content-language,
and [MIME-type](glossary.md#mime-type "see glossary") (content-type) of documents. The directive `TypesConfig` is used to specify a
file which also maps extensions onto MIME types.

In addition, `mod_mime` may define the [handler](handler.md) and [filters](filter.md) that originate and process
content. The directives `AddHandler`, `AddOutputFilter`, and `AddInputFilter` control the modules
or scripts that serve the document. The `MultiviewsMatch` directive allows
`mod_negotiation` to consider these file extensions
to be included when testing Multiviews matches.

While `mod_mime` associates meta-information
with filename extensions, the `core` server
provides directives that are used to associate all the files in a
given container (*e.g.*, `<Location>`, `<Directory>`, or `<Files>`) with particular
meta-information. These directives include `ForceType`, `SetHandler`, `SetInputFilter`, and `SetOutputFilter`. The core directives
override any filename extension mappings defined in
`mod_mime`.

Note that changing the meta-information for a file does not
change the value of the `Last-Modified` header.
Thus, previously cached copies may still be used by a client or
proxy, with the previous headers. If you change the
meta-information (language, content type, character set or
encoding) you may need to 'touch' affected files (updating
their last modified date) to ensure that all visitors are
receive the corrected content headers.

## Files with Multiple Extensions

Files can have more than one extension, and the order of the
extensions is *normally* irrelevant. For example, if the
file `welcome.html.fr` maps onto content type
`text/html` and language French then the file
`welcome.fr.html` will map onto exactly the same
information. If more than one extension is given that maps onto
the same type of meta-information, then the one to the right will
be used, except for languages and content encodings. For example,
if `.gif` maps to the [MIME-type](glossary.md#mime-type "see glossary")
`image/gif` and `.html` maps to the
MIME-type `text/html`, then the file
`welcome.gif.html` will be associated with the
MIME-type `text/html`.

[Languages](#charset-lang) and [content encodings](#contentencoding) are treated accumulative, because one can assign
more than one language or encoding to a particular resource. For example,
the file `welcome.html.en.de` will be delivered with
`Content-Language: en, de` and `Content-Type:
text/html`.

Care should be taken when a file with multiple extensions
gets associated with both a [MIME-type](glossary.md#mime-type "see glossary") and a handler. This will
usually result in the request being handled by the module associated
with the handler. For example, if the `.imap`
extension is mapped to the handler `imap-file` (from
`mod_imagemap`) and the `.html` extension is
mapped to the MIME-type `text/html`, then the file
`world.imap.html` will be associated with both the
`imap-file` handler and `text/html` MIME-type.
When it is processed, the `imap-file` handler will be used,
and so it will be treated as a `mod_imagemap` imagemap
file.

If you would prefer only the last dot-separated part of the
filename to be mapped to a particular piece of meta-data, then do
not use the `Add*` directives. For example, if you wish
to have the file `foo.html.cgi` processed as a CGI
script, but not the file `bar.cgi.html`, then instead
of using `AddHandler cgi-script .cgi`, use

### Configure handler based on final extension only

`<FilesMatch \.cgi$>
SetHandler cgi-script
</FilesMatch>`

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## Content encoding

A file of a particular [MIME-type](glossary.md#mime-type "see glossary") can additionally be encoded a
particular way to simplify transmission over the Internet.
While this usually will refer to compression, such as
`gzip`, it can also refer to encryption, such a
`pgp` or to an encoding such as UUencoding, which is
designed for transmitting a binary file in an ASCII (text)
format.

The [HTTP/1.1
RFC](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt), section 14.11 puts it this way:

> The Content-Encoding entity-header field is used as a modifier to
> the media-type. When present, its value indicates what additional
> content codings have been applied to the entity-body, and thus what
> decoding mechanisms must be applied in order to obtain the media-type
> referenced by the Content-Type header field. Content-Encoding is
> primarily used to allow a document to be compressed without losing
> the identity of its underlying media type.

By using more than one file extension (see [section above about multiple file
extensions](#multipleext)), you can indicate that a file is of a
particular *type*, and also has a particular
*encoding*.

For example, you may have a file which is a Microsoft Word
document, which is pkzipped to reduce its size. If the
`.doc` extension is associated with the Microsoft
Word file type, and the `.zip` extension is
associated with the pkzip file encoding, then the file
`Resume.doc.zip` would be known to be a pkzip'ed Word
document.

Apache sends a `Content-encoding` header with the
resource, in order to tell the client browser about the
encoding method.

`Content-encoding: pkzip`

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## Character sets and languages

In addition to file type and the file encoding,
another important piece of information is what language a
particular document is in, and in what character set the file
should be displayed. For example, the document might be written
in the Vietnamese alphabet, or in Cyrillic, and should be
displayed as such. This information, also, is transmitted in
HTTP headers.

The character set, language, encoding and mime type are all
used in the process of content negotiation (See
`mod_negotiation`) to determine
which document to give to the client, when there are
alternative documents in more than one character set, language,
encoding or mime type. All filename extensions associations
created with `AddCharset`,
`AddEncoding`, `AddLanguage` and `AddType` directives
(and extensions listed in the `MimeMagicFile`) participate in this select process.
Filename extensions that are only associated using the `AddHandler`, `AddInputFilter` or `AddOutputFilter` directives may be included or excluded
from matching by using the `MultiviewsMatch` directive.

### Charset

To convey this further information, Apache optionally sends
a `Content-Language` header, to specify the language
that the document is in, and can append additional information
onto the `Content-Type` header to indicate the
particular character set that should be used to correctly
render the information.

`Content-Language: en, fr  
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1`

The language specification is the two-letter abbreviation
for the language. The `charset` is the name of the
particular character set which should be used.

## AddCharset Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Maps the given filename extensions to the specified content charset |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `AddCharset charset extension [extension] ...` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_mime |

The `AddCharset` directive maps the given
filename extensions to the specified content charset. charset
is the [MIME
charset parameter](http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets) of filenames containing
extension. This mapping is added to any already in force,
overriding any mappings that already exist for the same
extension.

### Example

`AddLanguage ja .ja  
AddCharset EUC-JP .euc  
AddCharset ISO-2022-JP .jis  
AddCharset SHIFT_JIS .sjis`

Then the document `xxxx.ja.jis` will be treated
as being a Japanese document whose charset is `ISO-2022-JP`
(as will the document `xxxx.jis.ja`). The
`AddCharset` directive is useful for both to
inform the client about the character encoding of the document so that
the document can be interpreted and displayed appropriately, and for [content negotiation](content-negotiation.md),
where the server returns one from several documents based on
the client's charset preference.

The extension argument is case-insensitive and can
be specified with or without a leading dot. Filenames may have [multiple extensions](#multipleext) and the
extension argument will be compared against each of
them.

## AddEncoding Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Maps the given filename extensions to the specified encoding type |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `AddEncoding MIME-enc extension [extension] ...` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_mime |

The `AddEncoding` directive maps the given
filename extensions to the specified encoding type. MIME-enc
is the MIME encoding to use for documents containing the
extension. This mapping is added to any already in force,
overriding any mappings that already exist for the same
extension.

### Example

`AddEncoding x-gzip .gz  
AddEncoding x-compress .Z`

This will cause filenames containing the `.gz` extension
to be marked as encoded using the `x-gzip` encoding, and
filenames containing the `.Z` extension to be marked as
encoded with `x-compress`.

Old clients expect `x-gzip` and `x-compress`,
however the standard dictates that they're equivalent to
`gzip` and `compress` respectively. Apache does
content encoding comparisons by ignoring any leading `x-`.
When responding with an encoding Apache will use whatever form
(*i.e.*, `x-foo` or `foo`) the
client requested. If the client didn't specifically request a
particular form Apache will use the form given by the
`AddEncoding` directive. To make this long story
short, you should always use `x-gzip` and
`x-compress` for these two specific encodings. More
recent encodings, such as `deflate` should be
specified without the `x-`.

The extension argument is case-insensitive and can
be specified with or without a leading dot. Filenames may have [multiple extensions](#multipleext) and the
extension argument will be compared against each of
them.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## AddHandler Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Maps the filename extensions to the specified handler |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `AddHandler handler-name extension [extension] ...` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_mime |

Files having the name extension will be served by the
specified [handler-name](handler.md). This
mapping is added to any already in force, overriding any mappings that
already exist for the same extension. For example, to
activate CGI scripts with the file extension `.cgi`, you
might use:

`AddHandler cgi-script .cgi`

Once that has been put into your httpd.conf file, any file containing
the `.cgi` extension will be treated as a CGI program.

The extension argument is case-insensitive and can
be specified with or without a leading dot. Filenames may have [multiple extensions](#multipleext) and the
extension argument will be compared against each of
them.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## AddInputFilter Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Maps filename extensions to the filters that will process client requests |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `AddInputFilter filter[;filter...] extension [extension] ...` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_mime |
| [Compatibility:](mod__directive-dict.md#Compatibility) | AddInputFilter is only available in Apache 2.0.26 and later. |

`AddInputFilter` maps the filename extension
extension to the [filters](filter.md) which
will process client requests and POST input when they are received by
the server. This is in addition to any filters defined elsewhere,
including the `SetInputFilter`
directive. This mapping is merged over any already in force, overriding
any mappings that already exist for the same extension.

If more than one filter is specified, they must be separated
by semicolons in the order in which they should process the
content. The filter is case-insensitive.

The extension argument is case-insensitive and can
be specified with or without a leading dot. Filenames may have [multiple extensions](#multipleext) and the
extension argument will be compared against each of
them.

## AddLanguage Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Maps the given filename extension to the specified content language |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `AddLanguage MIME-lang extension [extension] ...` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_mime |

The `AddLanguage` directive maps the given
filename extension to the specified content language.
MIME-lang is the MIME language of filenames containing
extension. This mapping is added to any already in force,
overriding any mappings that already exist for the same
extension.

### Example

`AddEncoding x-compress .Z  
AddLanguage en .en  
AddLanguage fr .fr`

Then the document `xxxx.en.Z` will be treated as
being a compressed English document (as will the document
`xxxx.Z.en`). Although the content language is
reported to the client, the browser is unlikely to use this
information. The `AddLanguage` directive is
more useful for [content
negotiation](content-negotiation.md), where the server returns one from several documents
based on the client's language preference.

If multiple language assignments are made for the same
extension, the last one encountered is the one that is used.
That is, for the case of:

`AddLanguage en .en  
AddLanguage en-gb .en  
AddLanguage en-us .en`

documents with the extension `.en` would be treated as
being `en-us`.

The extension argument is case-insensitive and can
be specified with or without a leading dot. Filenames may have [multiple extensions](#multipleext) and the
extension argument will be compared against each of
them.

## AddOutputFilter Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Maps filename extensions to the filters that will process responses from the server |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `AddOutputFilter filter[;filter...] extension [extension] ...` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_mime |
| [Compatibility:](mod__directive-dict.md#Compatibility) | AddOutputFilter is only available in Apache 2.0.26 and later. |

The `AddOutputFilter` directive maps the
filename extension extension to the [filters](filter.md) which will process responses
from the server before they are sent to the client. This is in
addition to any filters defined elsewhere, including `SetOutputFilter` and `AddOutputFilterByType` directive. This mapping is merged
over any already in force, overriding any mappings that already exist
for the same extension.

For example, the following configuration will process all
`.shtml` files for server-side includes and will then
compress the output using `mod_deflate`.

`AddOutputFilter INCLUDES;DEFLATE shtml`

If more than one filter is specified, they must be separated
by semicolons in the order in which they should process the
content. The filter argument is case-insensitive.

The extension argument is case-insensitive and can
be specified with or without a leading dot. Filenames may have [multiple extensions](#multipleext) and the
extension argument will be compared against each of
them.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## AddType Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Maps the given filename extensions onto the specified content type |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `AddType MIME-type extension [extension] ...` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_mime |

The `AddType` directive maps the given
filename extensions onto the specified content
type. MIME-type is the [MIME
type](glossary.md#mime-type "see glossary") to use for filenames containing
extension. This mapping is added to any already in
force, overriding any mappings that already exist for the same
extension. This directive can be used to add mappings
not listed in the MIME types file (see the `TypesConfig` directive).

### Example

`AddType image/gif .gif`

It is recommended that new MIME types be added using the
`AddType` directive rather than changing the
`TypesConfig` file.

The extension argument is case-insensitive and can
be specified with or without a leading dot. Filenames may have [multiple extensions](#multipleext) and the
extension argument will be compared against each of
them.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## DefaultLanguage Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Sets all files in the given scope to the specified language |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `DefaultLanguage MIME-lang` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_mime |

The `DefaultLanguage` directive tells Apache
that all files in the directive's scope (*e.g.*, all files
covered by the current `<Directory>` container) that don't have an explicit language
extension (such as `.fr` or `.de` as configured
by `AddLanguage`) should be
considered to be in the specified MIME-lang language. This
allows entire directories to be marked as containing Dutch content, for
instance, without having to rename each file. Note that unlike using
extensions to specify languages, `DefaultLanguage`
can only specify a single language.

If no `DefaultLanguage` directive is in force,
and a file does not have any language extensions as configured
by `AddLanguage`, then that file
will be considered to have no language attribute.

### Example

`DefaultLanguage en`

## ModMimeUsePathInfo Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Tells `mod_mime` to treat `path_info` components as part of the filename |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `ModMimeUsePathInfo On|Off` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `ModMimeUsePathInfo Off` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | directory |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_mime |
| [Compatibility:](mod__directive-dict.md#Compatibility) | Available in Apache 2.0.41 and later |

The `ModMimeUsePathInfo` directive is used to
combine the filename with the `path_info` URL component to
apply `mod_mime`'s directives to the request. The default
value is `Off` - therefore, the `path_info`
component is ignored.

This directive is recommended when you have a virtual filesystem.

### Example

`ModMimeUsePathInfo On`

If you have a request for `/bar/foo.shtml` where
`/bar` is a Location and `ModMimeUsePathInfo` is `On`,
`mod_mime` will treat the incoming request as
`/bar/foo.shtml` and directives like `AddOutputFilter
INCLUDES .shtml` will add the `INCLUDES` filter to the
request. If `ModMimeUsePathInfo` is not set, the
`INCLUDES` filter will not be added.

## MultiviewsMatch Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | The types of files that will be included when searching for a matching file with MultiViews |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `MultiviewsMatch Any|NegotiatedOnly|Filters|Handlers [Handlers|Filters]` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `MultiviewsMatch NegotiatedOnly` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_mime |
| [Compatibility:](mod__directive-dict.md#Compatibility) | Available in Apache 2.0.26 and later. |

`MultiviewsMatch` permits three different
behaviors for [mod\_negotiation](mod__mod_negotiation.md)'s
Multiviews feature. Multiviews allows a request for a file,
*e.g.* `index.html`, to match any negotiated
extensions following the base request, *e.g.*
`index.html.en`, `index.html.fr`, or
`index.html.gz`.

The `NegotiatedOnly` option provides that every extension
following the base name must correlate to a recognized
`mod_mime` extension for content negotiation, *e.g.*
Charset, Content-Type, Language, or Encoding. This is the strictest
implementation with the fewest unexpected side effects, and is the
default behavior.

To include extensions associated with Handlers and/or Filters,
set the `MultiviewsMatch` directive to either
`Handlers`, `Filters`, or both option keywords.
If all other factors are equal, the smallest file will be served,
*e.g.* in deciding between `index.html.cgi` of 500
bytes and `index.html.pl` of 1000 bytes, the `.cgi`
file would win in this example. Users of `.asis` files
might prefer to use the Handler option, if `.asis` files are
associated with the `asis-handler`.

You may finally allow `Any` extensions to match, even if
`mod_mime` doesn't recognize the extension. This was the
behavior in Apache 1.3, and can cause unpredictable results, such as
serving .old or .bak files the webmaster never expected to be served.

For example, the following configuration will allow handlers
and filters to participate in Multviews, but will exclude unknown
files:

`MultiviewsMatch Handlers Filters`

`MultiviewsMatch` is not allowed in a
`<Location>` or `<LocationMatch>` section.

## RemoveCharset Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Removes any character set associations for a set of file extensions |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `RemoveCharset extension [extension] ...` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_mime |
| [Compatibility:](mod__directive-dict.md#Compatibility) | RemoveCharset is only available in Apache 2.0.24 and later. |

The `RemoveCharset` directive removes any
character set associations for files with the given extensions.
This allows `.htaccess` files in subdirectories to
undo any associations inherited from parent directories or the
server config files.

The extension argument is case-insensitive and can
be specified with or without a leading dot.

### Example

`RemoveCharset .html .shtml`

## RemoveEncoding Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Removes any content encoding associations for a set of file extensions |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `RemoveEncoding extension [extension] ...` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_mime |

The `RemoveEncoding` directive removes any
encoding associations for files with the given extensions. This
allows `.htaccess` files in subdirectories to undo
any associations inherited from parent directories or the
server config files. An example of its use might be:

### /foo/.htaccess:

`AddEncoding x-gzip .gz  
AddType text/plain .asc  
<Files *.gz.asc>  

RemoveEncoding .gz  
</Files>`

This will cause `foo.gz` to be marked as being
encoded with the gzip method, but `foo.gz.asc` as an
unencoded plaintext file.

### Note

`RemoveEncoding` directives are processed
*after* any `AddEncoding`
directives, so it is possible they may undo the effects of the latter
if both occur within the same directory configuration.

The extension argument is case-insensitive and can
be specified with or without a leading dot.

## RemoveHandler Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Removes any handler associations for a set of file extensions |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `RemoveHandler extension [extension] ...` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_mime |

The `RemoveHandler` directive removes any
handler associations for files with the given extensions. This allows
`.htaccess` files in subdirectories to undo any
associations inherited from parent directories or the server
config files. An example of its use might be:

### /foo/.htaccess:

`AddHandler server-parsed .html`

### /foo/bar/.htaccess:

`RemoveHandler .html`

This has the effect of returning `.html` files in
the `/foo/bar` directory to being treated as normal
files, rather than as candidates for parsing (see the `mod_include` module).

The extension argument is case-insensitive and can
be specified with or without a leading dot.

| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_mime |
| [Compatibility:](mod__directive-dict.md#Compatibility) | RemoveInputFilter is only available in Apache 2.0.26 and later. |

input [filter](filter.md) associations for files with
the given extensions.
This allows `.htaccess` files in subdirectories to
undo any associations inherited from parent directories or the
server config files.

The extension argument is case-insensitive and can
be specified with or without a leading dot.

| [Compatibility:](mod__directive-dict.md#Compatibility) | RemoveLanguage is only available in Apache 2.0.24 and later. |

The `RemoveLanguage` directive removes any
language associations for files with the given extensions. This
allows `.htaccess` files in subdirectories to undo
any associations inherited from parent directories or the
server config files.

The extension argument is case-insensitive and can
be specified with or without a leading dot.

| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_mime |
| [Compatibility:](mod__directive-dict.md#Compatibility) | RemoveOutputFilter is only available in Apache 2.0.26 and later. |

The `RemoveOutputFilter` directive removes any
output [filter](filter.md) associations for files with
the given extensions.
This allows `.htaccess` files in subdirectories to
undo any associations inherited from parent directories or the
server config files.

The extension argument is case-insensitive and can
be specified with or without a leading dot.

## RemoveType Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Removes any content type associations for a set of file extensions |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `RemoveType extension [extension] ...` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_mime |

The `RemoveType` directive removes any
[MIME type](glossary.md#mime-type "see glossary") associations for files with
the given extensions. This allows `.htaccess` files in
subdirectories to undo any associations inherited from parent
directories or the server config files. An example of its use
might be:

### /foo/.htaccess:

`RemoveType .cgi`

This will remove any special handling of `.cgi`
files in the `/foo/` directory and any beneath it,
causing the files to be treated as being of the `DefaultType`.

### Note

`RemoveType` directives are processed
*after* any `AddType`
directives, so it is possible they may undo the effects of the
latter if both occur within the same directory configuration.

The extension argument is case-insensitive and can
be specified with or without a leading dot.

## TypesConfig Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | The location of the `mime.types` file |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `TypesConfig file-path` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `TypesConfig conf/mime.types` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_mime |

The `TypesConfig` directive sets the
location of the [MIME types](glossary.md#mime-type "see glossary")
configuration file. File-path is relative to the
`ServerRoot`. This file sets
the default list of mappings from filename extensions to content
types. Most administrators use the provided
`mime.types` file, which associates common filename
extensions with IANA registered content types. The current list is
maintained at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/index.html>. This
simplifies the `httpd.conf` file by providing the
majority of media-type definitions, and may be overridden by
`AddType` directives as
needed. You should not edit the `mime.types` file,
because it may be replaced when you upgrade your server.

The file contains lines in the format of the arguments to
an `AddType` directive:

`MIME-type [extension] ...`

The case of the extension does not matter. Blank lines, and lines
beginning with a hash character (`#`) are ignored.

Please do **not** send requests to the Apache HTTP
Server Project to add any new entries in the distributed
`mime.types` file unless (1) they are already
registered with IANA, and (2) they use widely accepted,
non-conflicting filename extensions across platforms.
`category/x-subtype` requests will be automatically
rejected, as will any new two-letter extensions as they will
likely conflict later with the already crowded language and
character set namespace.
