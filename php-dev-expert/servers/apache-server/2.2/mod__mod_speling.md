# Apache Module mod\_speling

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__module-dict.md#Description) | Attempts to correct mistaken URLs that users might have entered by ignoring capitalization and by allowing up to one misspelling |
| [Status:](mod__module-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module Identifier:](mod__module-dict.md#ModuleIdentifier) | speling\_module |
| [Source File:](mod__module-dict.md#SourceFile) | mod\_speling.c |

### Summary

Requests to documents sometimes cannot be served by the core
apache server because the request was misspelled or
miscapitalized. This module addresses this problem by trying to
find a matching document, even after all other modules gave up.
It does its work by comparing each document name in the
requested directory against the requested document name
**without regard to case**, and allowing
**up to one misspelling** (character insertion /
omission / transposition or wrong character). A list is built
with all document names which were matched using this
strategy.

If, after scanning the directory,

- no matching document was found, Apache will proceed as
  usual and return a "document not found" error.
- only one document is found that "almost" matches the
  request, then it is returned in the form of a redirection
  response.
- more than one document with a close match was found, then
  the list of the matches is returned to the client, and the
  client can select the correct candidate.

## CheckCaseOnly Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Limits the action of the speling module to case corrections |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `CheckCaseOnly on|off` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `CheckCaseOnly Off` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | Options |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_speling |

When set, this directive limits the action of the spelling correction to lower/upper case changes.
Other potential corrections are not performed.

## CheckSpelling Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Enables the spelling module |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `CheckSpelling on|off` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `CheckSpelling Off` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | Options |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_speling |
| [Compatibility:](mod__directive-dict.md#Compatibility) | CheckSpelling was available as a separately available module for Apache 1.1, but was limited to miscapitalizations. As of Apache 1.3, it is part of the Apache distribution. Prior to Apache 1.3.2, the `CheckSpelling` directive was only available in the "server" and "virtual host" contexts. |

This directive enables or disables the spelling module. When
enabled, keep in mind that

- the directory scan which is necessary for the spelling
  correction will have an impact on the server's performance
  when many spelling corrections have to be performed at the
  same time.
- the document trees should not contain sensitive files
  which could be matched inadvertently by a spelling
  "correction".
- the module is unable to correct misspelled user names (as
  in `http://my.host/~apahce/`), just file names or
  directory names.
- spelling corrections apply strictly to existing files, so
  a request for the `<Location /status>` may
  get incorrectly treated as the negotiated file
  "`/stats.html`".

mod\_speling should not be enabled in [DAV](mod__mod_dav.md)
enabled directories, because it will try to "spell fix" newly created
resource names against existing filenames, e.g., when trying to upload
a new document `doc43.html` it might redirect to an existing
document `doc34.html`, which is not what was intended.
