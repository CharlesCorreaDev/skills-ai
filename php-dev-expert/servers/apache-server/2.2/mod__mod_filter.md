### Summary

This module enables smart, context-sensitive configuration of
output content filters. For example, apache can be configured to
process different content-types through different filters, even
when the content-type is not known in advance (e.g. in a proxy).

`mod_filter` works by introducing indirection into
the filter chain. Instead of inserting filters in the chain, we insert
a filter harness which in turn dispatches conditionally
to a filter provider. Any content filter may be used as a provider
to `mod_filter`; no change to existing filter modules is
required (although it may be possible to simplify them).

## Smart Filtering

In the traditional filtering model, filters are inserted unconditionally
using `AddOutputFilter` and family.
Each filter then needs to determine whether to run, and there is little
flexibility available for server admins to allow the chain to be
configured dynamically.

`mod_filter` by contrast gives server administrators a
great deal of flexibility in configuring the filter chain. In fact,
filters can be inserted based on any Request Header, Response Header
or Environment Variable. This generalises the limited flexibility offered
by `AddOutputFilterByType`, and fixes
it to work correctly with dynamic content, regardless of the
content generator. The ability to dispatch based on Environment
Variables offers the full flexibility of configuration with
`mod_rewrite` to anyone who needs it.

## Filter Declarations, Providers and Chains

![[This image displays the traditional filter model]](../images/mod_filter_old.gif)  
Figure 1: The traditional filter model

In the traditional model, output filters are a simple chain
from the content generator (handler) to the client. This works well
provided the filter chain can be correctly configured, but presents
problems when the filters need to be configured dynamically based on
the outcome of the handler.

![[This image shows the mod_filter model]](../images/mod_filter_new.gif)  
Figure 2: The `mod_filter` model

`mod_filter` works by introducing indirection into
the filter chain. Instead of inserting filters in the chain, we insert
a filter harness which in turn dispatches conditionally
to a filter provider. Any content filter may be used as a provider
to `mod_filter`; no change to existing filter modules
is required (although it may be possible to simplify them). There can be
multiple providers for one filter, but no more than one provider will
run for any single request.

A filter chain comprises any number of instances of the filter
harness, each of which may have any number of providers. A special
case is that of a single provider with unconditional dispatch: this
is equivalent to inserting the provider filter directly into the chain.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## Configuring the Chain

There are three stages to configuring a filter chain with
`mod_filter`. For details of the directives, see below.

Declare Filters
:   The `FilterDeclare` directive
    declares a filter, assigning it a name and filter type. Required
    only if the filter is not the default type AP\_FTYPE\_RESOURCE.

Register Providers
:   The `FilterProvider`
    directive registers a provider with a filter. The filter may have
    been declared with `FilterDeclare`; if not, FilterProvider will implicitly
    declare it with the default type AP\_FTYPE\_RESOURCE. The provider
    must have been
    registered with `ap_register_output_filter` by some module.
    The remaining arguments to `FilterProvider` are a dispatch criterion and a match string.
    The former may be an HTTP request or response header, an environment
    variable, or the Handler used by this request. The latter is matched
    to it for each request, to determine whether this provider will be
    used to implement the filter for this request.

Configure the Chain
:   The above directives build components of a smart filter chain,
    but do not configure it to run. The `FilterChain` directive builds a filter chain from smart
    filters declared, offering the flexibility to insert filters at the
    beginning or end of the chain, remove a filter, or clear the chain.

## Filtering and Response Status

mod\_filter normally only runs filters on responses with
HTTP status 200 (OK). If you want to filter documents with
other response statuses, you can set the filter-errordocs
environment variable, and it will work on all responses
regardless of status. To refine this further, you can use
expression conditions with `FilterProvider`.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## Examples

Server side Includes (SSI)
:   A simple case of using `mod_filter` in place of
    `AddOutputFilterByType`

    `FilterDeclare SSI  
    FilterProvider SSI INCLUDES resp=Content-Type $text/html  
    FilterChain SSI`

Server side Includes (SSI)
:   The same as the above but dispatching on handler (classic
    SSI behaviour; .shtml files get processed).

    `FilterProvider SSI INCLUDES Handler server-parsed  
    FilterChain SSI`

Emulating mod\_gzip with mod\_deflate
:   Insert INFLATE filter only if "gzip" is NOT in the
    Accept-Encoding header. This filter runs with ftype CONTENT\_SET.

    `FilterDeclare gzip CONTENT_SET  
    FilterProvider gzip inflate req=Accept-Encoding !$gzip  
    FilterChain gzip`

Image Downsampling
:   Suppose we want to downsample all web images, and have filters
    for GIF, JPEG and PNG.

    `FilterProvider unpack jpeg_unpack Content-Type $image/jpeg  
    FilterProvider unpack gif_unpack Content-Type $image/gif  
    FilterProvider unpack png_unpack Content-Type $image/png  
      
    FilterProvider downsample downsample_filter Content-Type $image  
    FilterProtocol downsample "change=yes"  
      
    FilterProvider repack jpeg_pack Content-Type $image/jpeg  
    FilterProvider repack gif_pack Content-Type $image/gif  
    FilterProvider repack png_pack Content-Type $image/png  
    <Location /image-filter>  

    FilterChain unpack downsample repack  
    </Location>`

## Protocol Handling

Historically, each filter is responsible for ensuring that whatever
changes it makes are correctly represented in the HTTP response headers,
and that it does not run when it would make an illegal change. This
imposes a burden on filter authors to re-implement some common
functionality in every filter:

- Many filters will change the content, invalidating existing content
  tags, checksums, hashes, and lengths.
- Filters that require an entire, unbroken response in input need to
  ensure they don't get byteranges from a backend.
- Filters that transform output in a filter need to ensure they don't
  violate a `Cache-Control: no-transform` header from the
  backend.
- Filters may make responses uncacheable.

`mod_filter` aims to offer generic handling of these
details of filter implementation, reducing the complexity required of
content filter modules. This is work-in-progress; the
`FilterProtocol` implements
some of this functionality for back-compatibility with Apache 2.0
modules. For httpd 2.1 and later, the
`ap_register_output_filter_protocol` and
`ap_filter_protocol` API enables filter modules to
declare their own behaviour.

At the same time, `mod_filter` should not interfere
with a filter that wants to handle all aspects of the protocol. By
default (i.e. in the absence of any `FilterProtocol` directives), `mod_filter`
will leave the headers untouched.

At the time of writing, this feature is largely untested,
as modules in common use are designed to work with 2.0.
Modules using it should test it carefully.

## FilterChain Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Configure the filter chain |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `FilterChain [+=-@!]filter-name ...` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | Options |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_filter |

This configures an actual filter chain, from declared filters.
`FilterChain` takes any number of arguments,
each optionally preceded with a single-character control that
determines what to do:

`+filter-name`
:   Add filter-name to the end of the filter chain

`@filter-name`
:   Insert filter-name at the start of the filter chain

`-filter-name`
:   Remove filter-name from the filter chain

`=filter-name`
:   Empty the filter chain and insert filter-name

`!`
:   Empty the filter chain

`filter-name`
:   Equivalent to `+filter-name`

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## FilterDeclare Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Declare a smart filter |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `FilterDeclare filter-name [type]` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | Options |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_filter |

This directive declares an output filter together with a
header or environment variable that will determine runtime
configuration. The first argument is a filter-name
for use in `FilterProvider`,
`FilterChain` and
`FilterProtocol` directives.

The final (optional) argument
is the type of filter, and takes values of `ap_filter_type`
- namely `RESOURCE` (the default), `CONTENT_SET`,
`PROTOCOL`, `TRANSCODE`, `CONNECTION`
or `NETWORK`.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## FilterProtocol Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Deal with correct HTTP protocol handling |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `FilterProtocol filter-name [provider-name] proto-flags` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | Options |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_filter |

This directs `mod_filter` to deal with ensuring the
filter doesn't run when it shouldn't, and that the HTTP response
headers are correctly set taking into account the effects of the
filter.

There are two forms of this directive. With three arguments, it
applies specifically to a filter-name and a
provider-name for that filter.
With two arguments it applies to a filter-name whenever the
filter runs *any* provider.

proto-flags is one or more of

`change=yes`
:   The filter changes the content, including possibly the content
    length

`change=1:1`
:   The filter changes the content, but will not change the content
    length

`byteranges=no`
:   The filter cannot work on byteranges and requires complete input

`proxy=no`
:   The filter should not run in a proxy context

`proxy=transform`
:   The filter transforms the response in a manner incompatible with
    the HTTP `Cache-Control: no-transform` header.

`cache=no`
:   The filter renders the output uncacheable (eg by introducing randomised
    content changes)

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## FilterProvider Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Register a content filter |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `FilterProvider filter-name provider-name [req|resp|env]=dispatch match` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | Options |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_filter |

This directive registers a *provider* for the smart filter.
The provider will be called if and only if the match declared
here matches the value of the header or environment variable declared
as dispatch.

provider-name must have been registered by loading
a module that registers the name with
`ap_register_output_filter`.

The dispatch argument is a string with optional
`req=`, `resp=` or `env=` prefix
causing it to dispatch on (respectively) the request header, response
header, or environment variable named. In the absence of a
prefix, it defaults to a response header. A special case is the
word `handler`, which causes `mod_filter`
to dispatch on the content handler.

The match argument specifies a match that will be applied to
the filter's dispatch criterion. The match may be
a string match (exact match or substring), a [regex](glossary.md#regex "see glossary"), an integer (greater, lessthan or equals), or
unconditional. The first characters of the match argument
determines this:

**First**, if the first character is an exclamation mark
(`!`), this reverses the rule, so the provider will be used
if and only if the match *fails*.

**Second**, it interprets the first character excluding
any leading `!` as follows:

| Character | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *(none)* | exact match |
| `$` | substring match |
| `/` | regex match (delimited by a second `/`) |
| `=` | integer equality |
| `<` | integer less-than |
| `<=` | integer less-than or equal |
| `>` | integer greater-than |
| `>=` | integer greater-than or equal |
| `*` | Unconditional match |

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## FilterTrace Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Get debug/diagnostic information from `mod_filter` |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `FilterTrace filter-name level` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_filter |

This directive generates debug information from
`mod_filter`.
It is designed to help test and debug providers (filter modules), although
it may also help with `mod_filter` itself.

The debug output depends on the level set:

`0` (default)
:   No debug information is generated.

`1`
:   `mod_filter` will record buckets and brigades
    passing through the filter to the error log, before the provider has
    processed them. This is similar to the information generated by
    [mod\_diagnostics](http://apache.webthing.com/mod_diagnostics/).

`2` (not yet implemented)
:   Will dump the full data passing through to a tempfile before the
    provider. **For single-user debug only**; this will not
    support concurrent hits.
