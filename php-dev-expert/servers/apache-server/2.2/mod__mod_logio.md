### Summary

This module provides the logging of input and output number of
bytes received/sent per request. The numbers reflect the actual bytes
as received on the network, which then takes into account the
headers and bodies of requests and responses. The counting is done
before SSL/TLS on input and after SSL/TLS on output, so the numbers
will correctly reflect any changes made by encryption.

This module requires `mod_log_config`.

When KeepAlive connections are used with SSL, the overhead of the SSL
handshake is reflected in the byte count of the first request on the
connection. When per-directory SSL renegotiation occurs, the bytes are associated
with the request that triggered the renegotiation.

## Custom Log Formats

This modules adds two new logging directives. The characteristics of the
request itself are logged by placing "`%`" directives in
the format string, which are replaced in the log file by the values as
follows:

| Format String | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `%...I` | Bytes received, including request and headers, cannot be zero. |
| `%...O` | Bytes sent, including headers, cannot be zero. |

Usually, the functionality is used like this:

Combined I/O log format:
:   `"%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\"
    \"%{User-agent}i\" %I %O"`
