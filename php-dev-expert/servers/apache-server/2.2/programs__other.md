# Other Programs

The following programs are simple support programs included with the
Apache HTTP Server which do not have their own manual pages. They are not
installed automatically. You can find them after the configuration process
in the `support/` directory.

## log\_server\_status

This perl script is designed to be run at a frequent interval by
something like cron. It connects to the server and downloads the status
information. It reformats the information to a single line and logs it to
a file. Adjust the variables at the top of the script to specify the
location of the resulting logfile.

## split-logfile

This perl script will take a combined Web server access log file and
break its contents into separate files. It assumes that the first field of
each line is the virtual host identity (put there by "`%v`"), and
that the logfiles should be named that + "`.log`" in the current
directory.

The combined log file is read from stdin. Records read will be appended
to any existing log files.
