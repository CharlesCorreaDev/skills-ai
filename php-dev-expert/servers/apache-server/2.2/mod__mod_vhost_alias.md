# Apache Module mod\_vhost\_alias

| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__module-dict.md#Description) | Provides for dynamically configured mass virtual hosting |
| [Status:](mod__module-dict.md#Status) | Extension |

### Summary

This module creates dynamically configured virtual hosts, by
allowing the IP address and/or the `Host:` header of
the HTTP request to be used as part of the pathname to
determine what files to serve. This allows for easy use of a
huge number of virtual hosts with similar configurations.

### Note

If `mod_alias` or `mod_userdir` are
used for translating URIs to filenames, they will override the
directives of `mod_vhost_alias` described below. For
example, the following configuration will map `/cgi-bin/script.pl` to `/usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/script.pl` in all cases:

`ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/  
VirtualScriptAlias /never/found/%0/cgi-bin/`

## Directory Name Interpolation

All the directives in this module interpolate a string into
a pathname. The interpolated string (henceforth called the
"name") may be either the server name (see the `UseCanonicalName`
directive for details on how this is determined) or the IP
address of the virtual host on the server in dotted-quad
format. The interpolation is controlled by specifiers inspired
by `printf` which have a number of formats:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| `%%` | insert a `%` |
| `%p` | insert the port number of the virtual host |
| `%N.M` | insert (part of) the name |

`N` and `M` are used to specify
substrings of the name. `N` selects from the
dot-separated components of the name, and `M`
selects characters within whatever `N` has selected.
`M` is optional and defaults to zero if it isn't
present; the dot must be present if and only if `M`
is present. The interpretation is as follows:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | the whole name |
| `1` | the first part |
| `2` | the second part |
| `-1` | the last part |
| `-2` | the penultimate part |
| `2+` | the second and all subsequent parts |
| `-2+` | the penultimate and all preceding parts |
| `1+` and `-1+` | the same as `0` |

If `N` or `M` is greater than the number
of parts available a single underscore is interpolated.

## Examples

For simple name-based virtual hosts you might use the
following directives in your server configuration file:

`UseCanonicalName Off  
VirtualDocumentRoot /usr/local/apache/vhosts/%0`

A request for
`http://www.example.com/directory/file.html` will be
satisfied by the file
`/usr/local/apache/vhosts/www.example.com/directory/file.html`.

For a very large number of virtual hosts it is a good idea
to arrange the files to reduce the size of the
`vhosts` directory. To do this you might use the
following in your configuration file:

`UseCanonicalName Off  
VirtualDocumentRoot /usr/local/apache/vhosts/%3+/%2.1/%2.2/%2.3/%2`

A request for
`http://www.domain.example.com/directory/file.html`
will be satisfied by the file
`/usr/local/apache/vhosts/example.com/d/o/m/domain/directory/file.html`.

A more even spread of files can be achieved by hashing from the
end of the name, for example:

`VirtualDocumentRoot /usr/local/apache/vhosts/%3+/%2.-1/%2.-2/%2.-3/%2`

The example request would come from
`/usr/local/apache/vhosts/example.com/n/i/a/domain/directory/file.html`.

Alternatively you might use:

`VirtualDocumentRoot /usr/local/apache/vhosts/%3+/%2.1/%2.2/%2.3/%2.4+`

The example request would come from
`/usr/local/apache/vhosts/example.com/d/o/m/ain/directory/file.html`.

For IP-based virtual hosting you might use the following in
your configuration file:

`UseCanonicalName DNS  
VirtualDocumentRootIP /usr/local/apache/vhosts/%1/%2/%3/%4/docs  
VirtualScriptAliasIP /usr/local/apache/vhosts/%1/%2/%3/%4/cgi-bin`

A request for
`http://www.domain.example.com/directory/file.html`
would be satisfied by the file
`/usr/local/apache/vhosts/10/20/30/40/docs/directory/file.html`
if the IP address of `www.domain.example.com` were
10.20.30.40. A request for
`http://www.domain.example.com/cgi-bin/script.pl` would
be satisfied by executing the program
`/usr/local/apache/vhosts/10/20/30/40/cgi-bin/script.pl`.

If you want to include the `.` character in a
`VirtualDocumentRoot` directive, but it clashes with
a `%` directive, you can work around the problem in
the following way:

`VirtualDocumentRoot /usr/local/apache/vhosts/%2.0.%3.0`

A request for
`http://www.domain.example.com/directory/file.html`
will be satisfied by the file
`/usr/local/apache/vhosts/domain.example/directory/file.html`.

The `LogFormat`
directives `%V` and `%A` are useful
in conjunction with this module.

## VirtualDocumentRoot Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Dynamically configure the location of the document root for a given virtual host |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `VirtualDocumentRoot interpolated-directory|none` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `VirtualDocumentRoot none` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_vhost\_alias |

The `VirtualDocumentRoot` directive allows you to
determine where Apache will find your documents based on the
value of the server name. The result of expanding
*interpolated-directory* is used as the root of the
document tree in a similar manner to the `DocumentRoot` directive's argument.
If *interpolated-directory* is `none` then
`VirtualDocumentRoot` is turned off. This directive
cannot be used in the same context as `VirtualDocumentRootIP`.

## VirtualDocumentRootIP Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Dynamically configure the location of the document root for a given virtual host |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `VirtualDocumentRootIP interpolated-directory|none` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `VirtualDocumentRootIP none` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_vhost\_alias |

The `VirtualDocumentRootIP` directive is like the
`VirtualDocumentRoot`
directive, except that it uses the IP address of the server end
of the connection for directory interpolation instead of the server
name.

## VirtualScriptAlias Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Dynamically configure the location of the CGI directory for a given virtual host |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `VirtualScriptAlias interpolated-directory|none` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `VirtualScriptAlias none` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_vhost\_alias |

The `VirtualScriptAlias` directive allows you to
determine where Apache will find CGI scripts in a similar
manner to `VirtualDocumentRoot` does for other documents. It matches
requests for URIs starting `/cgi-bin/`, much like `ScriptAlias`
`/cgi-bin/` would.

## VirtualScriptAliasIP Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Dynamically configure the location of the cgi directory for a given virtual host |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `VirtualScriptAliasIP interpolated-directory|none` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `VirtualScriptAliasIP none` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_vhost\_alias |

The `VirtualScriptAliasIP` directive is like the
`VirtualScriptAlias`
directive, except that it uses the IP address of the server end
of the connection for directory interpolation instead of the server
name.
