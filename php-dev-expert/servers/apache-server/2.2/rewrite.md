# Apache mod\_rewrite

`mod_rewrite` provides a way to modify incoming
URL requests, dynamically, based on [regular
expression](rewrite__intro.md#regex) rules. This allows you to map arbitrary URLs onto
your internal URL structure in any way you like.

It supports an unlimited number of rules and an
unlimited number of attached rule conditions for each rule to
provide a really flexible and powerful URL manipulation
mechanism. The URL manipulations can depend on various tests:
server variables, environment variables, HTTP
headers, time stamps, external database lookups, and various other
external programs or handlers, can be used to achieve granular URL
matching.

Rewrite rules can operate on the full URLs, including the path-info
and query string portions, and may be used in per-server context
(`httpd.conf`), per-virtualhost context (`<VirtualHost>` blocks), or
per-directory context (`.htaccess` files and `<Directory>` blocks). The
rewritten result can lead to further rules, internal
sub-processing, external request redirection, or proxy
passthrough, depending on what [flags](rewrite__flags.md) you
attach to the rules.

Since mod\_rewrite is so powerful, it can indeed be rather
complex. This document supplements the [reference documentation](mod__mod_rewrite.md), and
attempts to allay some of that complexity, and provide highly
annotated examples of common scenarios that you may handle with
mod\_rewrite. But we also attempt to show you when you should not
use mod\_rewrite, and use other standard Apache features instead,
thus avoiding this unnecessary complexity.
