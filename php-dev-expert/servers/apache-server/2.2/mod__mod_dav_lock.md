# Apache Module mod\_dav\_lock

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__module-dict.md#Description) | generic locking module for `mod_dav` |
| [Status:](mod__module-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module Identifier:](mod__module-dict.md#ModuleIdentifier) | dav\_lock\_module |
| [Source File:](mod__module-dict.md#SourceFile) | mod\_dav\_lock.c |
| [Compatibility:](mod__module-dict.md#Compatibility) | Available in version 2.1 and later |

### Summary

This module implements a generic locking API which can be used by any
backend provider of `mod_dav`. It *requires* at least
the service of `mod_dav`. But without a backend provider
which makes use of it, it's useless and should not be loaded into the
server. A sample backend module which actually utilizes
`mod_dav_lock` is [mod\_dav\_svn](http://subversion.apache.org/), the subversion provider module.

Note that `mod_dav_fs` does *not* need this
generic locking module, because it uses its own more specialized
version.

In order to make `mod_dav_lock` functional, you just have
to specify the location of the lock database using the `DavGenericLockDB` directive described
below.

### Developer's Note

In order to retrieve the pointer to the locking provider function, you
have to use the `ap_lookup_provider` API with the arguments
`dav-lock`, `generic`, and `0`.

## DavGenericLockDB Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Location of the DAV lock database |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `DavGenericLockDB file-path` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_dav\_lock |

Use the `DavGenericLockDB` directive to specify
the full path to the lock database, excluding an extension. If
the path is not absolute, it will be interpreted relative to `ServerRoot`. The implementation of
`mod_dav_lock` uses a SDBM database to track user
locks.

### Example

`DavGenericLockDB var/DavLock`

The directory containing the lock database file must be
writable by the `User`
and `Group` under which
Apache is running. For security reasons, you should create a
directory for this purpose rather than changing the permissions on
an existing directory. In the above example, Apache will create
files in the `var/` directory under the `ServerRoot` with the base filename
`DavLock` and an extension added by the server.
