# suexec - Switch user before executing external programs

`suexec` is used by the Apache HTTP Server to switch
to another user before executing CGI programs. In order to achieve this,
it must run as `root`. Since the HTTP daemon normally doesn't
run as `root`, the `suexec` executable needs the
setuid bit set and must be owned by `root`. It should never be
writable for any other person than `root`.

For further information about the concepts and the security model
of suexec please refer to the suexec documentation (<http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/suexec.html>).

    changeable only at compile time.
