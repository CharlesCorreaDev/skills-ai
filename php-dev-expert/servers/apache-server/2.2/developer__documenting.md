# Documenting Apache 2.0

Apache 2.0 uses [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/) to
document the APIs and global variables in the code. This will explain
the basics of how to document using Doxygen.

## Brief Description

To start a documentation block, use `/**`  
To end a documentation block, use `*/`

In the middle of the block, there are multiple tags we can
use:

`Description of this functions purpose  
@param parameter_name description  
@return description  
@deffunc signature of the function`

The `deffunc` is not always necessary. DoxyGen does not
have a full parser in it, so any prototype that use a macro in the
return type declaration is too complex for scandoc. Those functions
require a `deffunc`. An example (using &gt; rather
than >):

`/**  
 * return the final element of the pathname  
 * @param pathname The path to get the final element of  
 * @return the final element of the path  
 * @tip Examples:  
 * <pre>  
 * "/foo/bar/gum" -&gt; "gum"  
 * "/foo/bar/gum/" -&gt; ""  
 * "gum" -&gt; "gum"  
 * "wi\\n32\\stuff" -&gt; "stuff"  
 * </pre>  
 * @deffunc const char * ap_filename_of_pathname(const char *pathname)  
 */`

At the top of the header file, always include:

`/**  
 * @package Name of library header  
 */`

Doxygen uses a new HTML file for each package. The HTML files are named
{Name\_of\_library\_header}.html, so try to be concise with your names.

For a further discussion of the possibilities please refer to
[the Doxygen site](http://www.doxygen.org/).
