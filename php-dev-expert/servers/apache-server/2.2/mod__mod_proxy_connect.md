# Apache Module mod\_proxy\_connect

| [Description:](mod__module-dict.md#Description) | `mod_proxy` extension for `CONNECT` request handling |
| [Status:](mod__module-dict.md#Status) | Extension |

### Summary

This module *requires* the service of `mod_proxy`. It provides support for the `CONNECT`
HTTP method. This method is mainly used to tunnel SSL requests
through proxy servers.

Thus, in order to get the ability of handling `CONNECT`
requests, `mod_proxy` and
`mod_proxy_connect` have to be present in the server.

CONNECT is also used, when the server needs to send an HTTPS request
through a forward proxy. In this case the server acts as a CONNECT client.
This functionality is part of `mod_proxy` and
`mod_proxy_connect` is not needed in this case.

### Warning

Do not enable proxying until you have [secured your server](mod__mod_proxy.md#access). Open proxy
servers are dangerous both to your network and to the Internet at
large.

### Directives

This module provides no
directives.
