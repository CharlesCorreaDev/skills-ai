# Using mod\_rewrite for Proxying

This document supplements the `mod_rewrite`
[reference documentation](mod__mod_rewrite.md). It describes
how to use the RewriteRule's [P] flag to proxy content to another server.
A number of recipes are provided that describe common scenarios.

## Proxying Content with mod\_rewrite

Description:
:   mod\_rewrite provides the [P] flag, which allows URLs to be passed,
    via mod\_proxy, to another server. Two examples are given here. In
    one example, a URL is passed directly to another server, and served
    as though it were a local URL. In the other example, we proxy
    missing content to a back-end server.

Solution:
:   To simply map a URL to another server, we use the [P] flag, as
    follows:

    `RewriteEngine on  
    RewriteBase /products/  
    RewriteRule ^widget/(.*)$ http://product.example.com/widget/$1 [P]  
    ProxyPassReverse /products/widget/ http://product.example.com/widget/`

    In the second example, we proxy the request only if we can't find
    the resource locally. This can be very useful when you're migrating
    from one server to another, and you're not sure if all the content
    has been migrated yet.

    `RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f  
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d  
    RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://old.example.com/$1 [P]  
    ProxyPassReverse / http://old.example.com/`

Discussion:
:   In each case, we add a `ProxyPassReverse` directive to ensure
    that any redirects issued by the backend are correctly passed on to
    the client.

    Consider using either `ProxyPass` or `ProxyPassMatch` whenever possible in
    preference to mod\_rewrite.
