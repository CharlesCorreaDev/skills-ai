basic web server complies with the following IETF recommendations:

:   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
    protocol with the lightness and speed necessary for distributed,
    collaborative, hypermedia information systems. This documents
    HTTP/1.0.

[RFC 2616](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt) (Standards Track)

the following IETF and W3C recommendations:

[RFC 2854](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2854.txt) (Informational)
:   This document summarizes the history of HTML development,
    and defines the "text/html" MIME type by pointing to the relevant
    W3C recommendations.

    the publishing language of the World Wide Web. This specification
    defines HTML 4.01, which is a subversion of HTML 4.

[HTML 3.2 Reference Specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32)
:   The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a simple markup language
    used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one
    platform to another. HTML documents are SGML documents.

[XHTML 1.1 - Module-based XHTML](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/) ([Errata](http://www.w3.org/2001/04/REC-xhtml-modularization-20010410-errata))
:   This Recommendation defines a new XHTML document type
    that is based upon the module framework and modules defined in
    Modularization of XHTML.

## Language/Country Codes

The following links document ISO and other language and country
code information:

[ISO 639-2](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/)
:   ISO 639 provides two sets of language codes, one as a two-letter
    code set (639-1) and another as a three-letter code set (this part
    of ISO 639) for the representation of names of languages.

[ISO 3166-1](http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/index.html)
:   These pages document the country names (official short names
    in English) in alphabetical order as given in ISO 3166-1 and the
    corresponding ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 code elements.

[BCP 47](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) (Best Current Practice), [RFC 3066](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt)
:   This document describes a language tag for use in cases where
    it is desired to indicate the language used in an information
    object, how to register values for use in this language tag,
    and a construct for matching such language tags.

[RFC 3282](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3282.txt) (Standards Track)
:   This document defines a "Content-language:" header, for use in
    cases where one desires to indicate the language of something that
    has RFC 822-like headers, like MIME body parts or Web documents,
    and an "Accept-Language:" header for use in cases where one wishes
    to indicate one's preferences with regard to language.
