# Environment Variables in Apache

The Apache HTTP Server provides a mechanism for storing
information in named variables that are called *environment
variables*. This information can be used to control various
operations such as logging or access control. The variables are
also used as a mechanism to communicate with external programs
such as CGI scripts. This document discusses different ways to
manipulate and use these variables.

Although these variables are referred to as *environment
variables*, they are not the same as the environment
variables controlled by the underlying operating system.
Instead, these variables are stored and manipulated in an
internal Apache structure. They only become actual operating
system environment variables when they are provided to CGI
scripts and Server Side Include scripts. If you wish to
manipulate the operating system environment under which the
server itself runs, you must use the standard environment
manipulation mechanisms provided by your operating system
shell.

## Setting Environment Variables

| Related Modules | Related Directives |
| --- | --- |
| - `mod_env` - `mod_rewrite` - `mod_setenvif` - `mod_unique_id` | - `BrowserMatch` - `BrowserMatchNoCase` - `PassEnv` - `RewriteRule` - `SetEnv` - `SetEnvIf` - `SetEnvIfNoCase` - `UnsetEnv` |

### Basic Environment Manipulation

The most basic way to set an environment variable in Apache
is using the unconditional `SetEnv` directive. Variables may also be passed from
the environment of the shell which started the server using the
`PassEnv` directive.

### Conditional Per-Request Settings

For additional flexibility, the directives provided by
`mod_setenvif` allow environment variables to be set
on a per-request basis, conditional on characteristics of particular
requests. For example, a variable could be set only when a
specific browser (User-Agent) is making a request, or only when
a specific Referer [sic] header is found. Even more flexibility
is available through the `mod_rewrite`'s `RewriteRule` which uses the
`[E=...]` option to set environment variables.

### Unique Identifiers

Finally, `mod_unique_id` sets the environment
variable `UNIQUE_ID` for each request to a value which is
guaranteed to be unique across "all" requests under very
specific conditions.

### Standard CGI Variables

In addition to all environment variables set within the
Apache configuration and passed from the shell, CGI scripts and
SSI pages are provided with a set of environment variables
containing meta-information about the request as required by
the [CGI
specification](http://www.w3.org/CGI/).

### Some Caveats

- It is not possible to override or change the standard CGI
  variables using the environment manipulation directives.
- When `suexec` is used to launch
  CGI scripts, the environment will be cleaned down to a set of
  *safe* variables before CGI scripts are launched. The
  list of *safe* variables is defined at compile-time in
  `suexec.c`.
- For portability reasons, the names of environment
  variables may contain only letters, numbers, and the
  underscore character. In addition, the first character may
  not be a number. Characters which do not match this
  restriction will be replaced by an underscore when passed to
  CGI scripts and SSI pages.
- The `SetEnv` directive runs
  late during request processing meaning that directives such as
  `SetEnvIf` and `RewriteCond` will not see the
  variables set with it.

## Using Environment Variables

| Related Modules | Related Directives |
| --- | --- |
| - `mod_authz_host` - `mod_cgi` - `mod_ext_filter` - `mod_headers` - `mod_include` - `mod_log_config` - `mod_rewrite` | - `Allow` - `CustomLog` - `Deny` - `ExtFilterDefine` - `Header` - `LogFormat` - `RewriteCond` - `RewriteRule` |

### CGI Scripts

One of the primary uses of environment variables is to
communicate information to CGI scripts. As discussed above, the
environment passed to CGI scripts includes standard
meta-information about the request in addition to any variables
set within the Apache configuration. For more details, see the
[CGI tutorial](howto__cgi.md).

### SSI Pages

Server-parsed (SSI) documents processed by
`mod_include`'s
`INCLUDES` filter can print environment variables
using the `echo` element, and can use environment
variables in flow control elements to makes parts of a page
conditional on characteristics of a request. Apache also
provides SSI pages with the standard CGI environment variables
as discussed above. For more details, see the [SSI tutorial](howto__ssi.md).

### Access Control

Access to the server can be controlled based on the value of
environment variables using the `allow from env=`
and `deny from env=` directives. In combination with
`SetEnvIf`, this
allows for flexible control of access to the server based on
characteristics of the client. For example, you can use these
directives to deny access to a particular browser (User-Agent).

### Conditional Logging

Environment variables can be logged in the access log using
the `LogFormat`
option `%e`. In addition, the decision on whether
or not to log requests can be made based on the status of
environment variables using the conditional form of the
`CustomLog`
directive. In combination with `SetEnvIf` this allows for flexible control of which
requests are logged. For example, you can choose not to log
requests for filenames ending in `gif`, or you can
choose to only log requests from clients which are outside your
subnet.

### Conditional Response Headers

The `Header`
directive can use the presence or
absence of an environment variable to determine whether or not
a certain HTTP header will be placed in the response to the
client. This allows, for example, a certain response header to
be sent only if a corresponding header is received in the
request from the client.

### External Filter Activation

External filters configured by `mod_ext_filter`
using the `ExtFilterDefine` directive can
by activated conditional on an environment variable using the
`disableenv=` and `enableenv=` options.

### URL Rewriting

The `%{ENV:variable}` form of
*TestString* in the `RewriteCond` allows `mod_rewrite`'s rewrite
engine to make decisions conditional on environment variables. Note
that the variables accessible in `mod_rewrite` without
the `ENV:` prefix are not actually environment variables.
Rather, they are variables special to `mod_rewrite`
which cannot be accessed from other modules.

## Special Purpose Environment Variables

Interoperability problems have led to the introduction of
mechanisms to modify the way Apache behaves when talking to
particular clients. To make these mechanisms as flexible as
possible, they are invoked by defining environment variables,
typically with `BrowserMatch`, though `SetEnv` and `PassEnv` could also be used, for example.

### downgrade-1.0

This forces the request to be treated as a HTTP/1.0 request
even if it was in a later dialect.

### force-gzip

If you have the `DEFLATE` filter activated, this
environment variable will ignore the accept-encoding setting of
your browser and will send compressed output unconditionally.

### force-no-vary

This causes any `Vary` fields to be removed from
the response header before it is sent back to the client. Some
clients don't interpret this field correctly; setting this
variable can work around this problem. Setting this variable
also implies **force-response-1.0**.

### force-response-1.0

This forces an HTTP/1.0 response to clients making an HTTP/1.0
request. It was originally
implemented as a result of a problem with AOL's proxies. Some
HTTP/1.0 clients may not behave correctly when given an HTTP/1.1
response, and this can be used to interoperate with them.

### gzip-only-text/html

When set to a value of "1", this variable disables the
`DEFLATE` output filter provided by
`mod_deflate` for content-types other than
`text/html`. If you'd rather
use statically compressed files, `mod_negotiation`
evaluates the variable as well (not only for gzip, but for all
encodings that differ from "identity").

### no-gzip

When set, the `DEFLATE` filter of
`mod_deflate` will be turned off and
`mod_negotiation` will refuse to deliver encoded
resources.

### no-cache

*Available in versions 2.2.12 and later*

When set, `mod_cache` will not save an otherwise
cacheable response. This environment variable does not influence
whether a response already in the cache will be served for the current
request.

### nokeepalive

This disables `KeepAlive`
when set.

### prefer-language

This influences `mod_negotiation`'s behaviour. If
it contains a language tag (such as `en`, `ja`
or `x-klingon`), `mod_negotiation` tries
to deliver a variant with that language. If there's no such variant,
the normal [negotiation](content-negotiation.md) process
applies.

### redirect-carefully

This forces the server to be more careful when sending a redirect
to the client. This is typically used when a client has a known
problem handling redirects. This was originally implemented as a
result of a problem with Microsoft's WebFolders software which has
a problem handling redirects on directory resources via DAV
methods.

### suppress-error-charset

*Available in versions after 2.0.54*

When Apache issues a redirect in response to a client request,
the response includes some actual text to be displayed in case
the client can't (or doesn't) automatically follow the redirection.
Apache ordinarily labels this text according to the character set
which it uses, which is ISO-8859-1.

However, if the redirection is to a page that uses a different
character set, some broken browser versions will try to use the
character set from the redirection text rather than the actual page.
This can result in Greek, for instance, being incorrectly rendered.

Setting this environment variable causes Apache to omit the character
set for the redirection text, and these broken browsers will then correctly
use that of the destination page.

### Security note

Sending error pages without a specified character set may
allow a cross-site-scripting attack for existing browsers (MSIE)
which do not follow the HTTP/1.1 specification and attempt to
"guess" the character set from the content. Such browsers can
be easily fooled into using the UTF-7 character set, and UTF-7
content from input data (such as the request-URI) will not be
escaped by the usual escaping mechanisms designed to prevent
cross-site-scripting attacks.

### force-proxy-request-1.0, proxy-nokeepalive, proxy-sendchunked, proxy-sendcl, proxy-chain-auth, proxy-interim-response, proxy-initial-not-pooled

These directives alter the protocol behavior of
`mod_proxy`. See the `mod_proxy` and `mod_proxy_http`
documentation for more details.

## Examples

### Changing protocol behavior with misbehaving clients

Earlier versions recommended that the following lines be included in
httpd.conf to deal with known client problems. Since the affected clients
are no longer seen in the wild, this configuration is likely no-longer
necessary.

```
#
# The following directives modify normal HTTP response behavior.
# The first directive disables keepalive for Netscape 2.x and browsers that
# spoof it. There are known problems with these browser implementations.
# The second directive is for Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0b2
# which has a broken HTTP/1.1 implementation and does not properly
# support keepalive when it is used on 301 or 302 (redirect) responses.
#
BrowserMatch "Mozilla/2" nokeepalive
BrowserMatch "MSIE 4\.0b2;" nokeepalive downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0

#
# The following directive disables HTTP/1.1 responses to browsers which
# are in violation of the HTTP/1.0 spec by not being able to grok a
# basic 1.1 response.
#
BrowserMatch "RealPlayer 4\.0" force-response-1.0
BrowserMatch "Java/1\.0" force-response-1.0
BrowserMatch "JDK/1\.0" force-response-1.0
```

### Do not log requests for images in the access log

This example keeps requests for images from appearing in the
access log. It can be easily modified to prevent logging of
particular directories, or to prevent logging of requests
coming from particular hosts.

`SetEnvIf Request_URI \.gif image-request  
SetEnvIf Request_URI \.jpg image-request  
SetEnvIf Request_URI \.png image-request  
CustomLog logs/access_log common env=!image-request`

### Prevent "Image Theft"

This example shows how to keep people not on your server
from using images on your server as inline-images on their
pages. This is not a recommended configuration, but it can work
in limited circumstances. We assume that all your images are in
a directory called /web/images.

`SetEnvIf Referer "^http://www\.example\.com/" local_referal  
# Allow browsers that do not send Referer info  
SetEnvIf Referer "^$" local_referal  
<Directory /web/images>
Order Deny,Allow  
Deny from all  
Allow from env=local_referal
</Directory>`

"[Keeping Your Images from Adorning Other Sites](http://www.serverwatch.com/tutorials/article.php/1132731)" tutorial on
ServerWatch.
