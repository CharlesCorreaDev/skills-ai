# Compiling and Installing

This document covers compilation and installation of the Apache HTTP
Server on Unix and Unix-like systems only. For compiling and
installation on Windows, see [Using Apache HTTPd with Microsoft
Windows](platform__windows.md). For other platforms, see the [platform](platform.md) documentation.

Apache HTTPd uses `libtool` and `autoconf`
to create a build environment that looks like many other Open Source
projects.

If you are upgrading from one minor version to the next (for
example, 2.2.50 to 2.2.51), please skip down to the [upgrading](#upgrading) section.

*NN* must be replaced with the current version
number, and *PREFIX* must be replaced with the
filesystem path under which the server should be installed. If
*PREFIX* is not specified, it defaults to
`/usr/local/apache2`.

Each section of the compilation and installation process is
described in more detail below, beginning with the requirements
for compiling and installing Apache HTTP Server.

[![top](./images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## Requirements

The following requirements exist for building Apache HTTPd:

Disk Space
:   Make sure you have at least 50 MB of temporary free disk
    space available. After installation Apache occupies
    approximately 10 MB of disk space. The actual disk space
    requirements will vary considerably based on your chosen
    configuration options and any third-party modules.

ANSI-C Compiler and Build System
:   Make sure you have an ANSI-C compiler installed. The [GNU C
    compiler (GCC)](http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html) from the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](http://www.gnu.org/)
    is recommended. If you don't have GCC
    then at least make sure your vendor's compiler is ANSI
    compliant. In addition, your `PATH` must contain
    basic build tools such as `make`.

Accurate time keeping
:   Elements of the HTTP protocol are expressed as the time of
    day. So, it's time to investigate setting some time
    synchronization facility on your system. Usually the
    `ntpdate` or `xntpd` programs are used for
    this purpose which are based on the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
    See the [NTP
    homepage](http://www.ntp.org) for more details about NTP software and public
    time servers.

[Perl 5](http://www.perl.org/) [OPTIONAL]
:   For some of the support scripts like `apxs` or `dbmmanage` (which are
    written in Perl) the Perl 5 interpreter is required (versions
    5.003 or newer are sufficient). If no Perl 5 interpreter is found by the
    `configure` script, you will not be able to use
    the affected support scripts. Of course, you will still be able to
    build and use Apache HTTPd.

[apr/apr-util >= 1.4](http://apr.apache.org)
:   `apr` and `apr-util` are bundled
    with the Apache HTTPd source releases, and will be used without any
    problems in almost all circumstances. However, if
    `apr` or `apr-util`, versions 1.0, 1.1 or 1.2,
    are installed on your system, you must either upgrade your
    `apr`/`apr-util` installations to
    1.4, force the use of the bundled libraries or have httpd use
    separate builds. To use the bundled
    `apr`/`apr-util` sources specify the
    `--with-included-apr` option to configure:

    ### Note

    The --with-included-apr option was added in version 2.2.3

    `# Force the use of the bundled apr/apr-util  
    ./configure --with-included-apr`

    To build Apache HTTPd against a manually installed
    `apr`/`apr-util`:

    `# Build and install apr 1.4  
    cd srclib/apr  
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apr-httpd/  
    make  
    make install  
      
    # Build and install apr-util 1.4  
    cd ../apr-util  
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apr-util-httpd/
    --with-apr=/usr/local/apr-httpd/  
    make  
    make install  
      
    # Configure httpd  
    cd ../../  
    ./configure --with-apr=/usr/local/apr-httpd/
    --with-apr-util=/usr/local/apr-util-httpd/`

## Download

The Apache HTTP Server can be downloaded from the [Apache HTTP Server
download site](http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi), which lists several mirrors. Most users of
Apache HTTPd on unix-like systems will be better off downloading and
compiling a source version. The build process (described below) is
easy, and it allows you to customize your server to suit your needs.
In addition, binary releases are often not up to date with the latest
source releases. If you do download a binary, follow the instructions
in the `INSTALL.bindist` file inside the distribution.

After downloading, it is important to verify that you have a
complete and unmodified version of the Apache HTTP Server. This
can be accomplished by testing the downloaded tarball against the
PGP signature. Details on how to do this are available on the [download
page](http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi#verify) and an extended example is available describing the [use of
PGP](http://httpd.apache.org/dev/verification.html).

[![top](./images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## Extract

Extracting the source from the Apache HTTPd tarball is a
simple matter of uncompressing, and then untarring:

`$ gzip -d httpd-NN.tar.gz  
$ tar xvf httpd-NN.tar`

This will create a new directory under the current directory
containing the source code for the distribution. You should
`cd` into that directory before proceeding with
compiling the server.

[![top](./images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## Configuring the source tree

The next step is to configure the Apache HTTPd source tree for your
particular platform and personal requirements. This is done using
the script `configure` included in
the root directory of the distribution. (Developers downloading
an unreleased version of the Apache HTTPd source tree will need to have
`autoconf` and `libtool` installed and will
need to run `buildconf` before proceeding with the next
steps. This is not necessary for official releases.)

To configure the source tree using all the default options,
simply type `./configure`. To change the default
options, `configure` accepts a variety of variables
and command line options.

The most important option is the location `--prefix`
where the Apache HTTP Server is to be installed later, because Apache
HTTPd has to be
configured for this location to work correctly. More fine-tuned
control of the location of files is possible with additional [configure
options](programs__configure.md#installationdirectories).

Also at this point, you can specify which [features](programs__configure.md#optionalfeatures) you
want included in Apache HTTPd by enabling and disabling [modules](mod.md). The Apache HTTP Server comes with a [Base](mod__module-dict.md#Status) set of modules included by
default. Other modules are enabled using the
`--enable-module` option, where
module is the name of the module with the
`mod_` string removed and with any underscore converted
to a dash. You can also choose to compile modules as [shared objects (DSOs)](dso.md) -- which can be loaded
or unloaded at runtime -- by using the option
`--enable-module=shared`. Similarly, you can
disable Base modules with the
`--disable-module` option. Be careful when
using these options, since `configure` cannot warn you
if the module you specify does not exist; it will simply ignore the
option.

In addition, it is sometimes necessary to provide the
`configure` script with extra information about the
location of your compiler, libraries, or header files. This is
done by passing either environment variables or command line
options to `configure`. For more information, see the
`configure` manual page.

For a short impression of what possibilities you have, here
is a typical example which compiles Apache for the installation
tree `/sw/pkg/apache` with a particular compiler and flags
plus the two additional modules `mod_rewrite` and
`mod_speling` for
later loading through the DSO mechanism:

`$ CC="pgcc" CFLAGS="-O2" \  
./configure --prefix=/sw/pkg/apache \  
--enable-rewrite=shared \  
--enable-speling=shared`

When `configure` is run it will take several minutes to
test for the availability of features on your system and build
Makefiles which will later be used to compile the server.

Details on all the different `configure` options are
available on the `configure` manual page.

[![top](./images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## Build

Now you can build the various parts which form the Apache HTTPd
package by simply running the command:

`$ make`

Please be patient here, since a base configuration takes
several minutes to compile and the time will vary widely
depending on your hardware and the number of modules that you
have enabled.

[![top](./images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## Install

Now it's time to install the package under the configured
installation *PREFIX* (see `--prefix` option
above) by running:

`$ make install`

If you are upgrading, the installation will not overwrite
your configuration files or documents.

[![top](./images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## Customize

Next, you can customize your Apache HTTP Server by editing
the [configuration files](configuring.md) under
`PREFIX/conf/`.

`$ vi PREFIX/conf/httpd.conf`

Have a look at the Apache manual under
`PREFIX/docs/manual/` or consult <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/> for the most recent
version of this manual and a complete reference of available [configuration directives](mod__directives.md).

[![top](./images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## Test

Now you can [start](invoking.md) your Apache
HTTP Server by immediately running:

`$ PREFIX/bin/apachectl -k start`

and then you should be able to request your first document
via URL `http://localhost/`. The web page you see is located
under the `DocumentRoot`,
which will usually be `PREFIX/htdocs/`.
Then [stop](stopping.md) the server again by
running:

`$ PREFIX/bin/apachectl -k stop`

[![top](./images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## Upgrading

The first step in upgrading is to read the release announcement
and the file `CHANGES` in the source distribution to
find any changes that may affect your site. When changing between
major releases (for example, from 1.3 to 2.0 or from 2.0 to 2.2),
there will likely be major differences in the compile-time and
run-time configuration that will require manual adjustments. All
modules will also need to be upgraded to accommodate changes in the
module API.

Upgrading from one minor version to the next (for example, from
2.2.55 to 2.2.57) is easier. The `make install`
process will not overwrite any of your existing documents, log
files, or configuration files. In addition, the developers make
every effort to avoid incompatible changes in the
`configure` options, run-time configuration, or the
module API between minor versions. In most cases you should be able to
use an identical `configure` command line, an identical
configuration file, and all of your modules should continue to
work.

To upgrade across minor versions, start by finding the file
`config.nice` in the `build` directory of
your installed server or at the root of the source tree for your
old install. This will contain the exact
`configure` command line that you used to
configure the source tree. Then to upgrade from one version to
the next, you need only copy the `config.nice` file to
the source tree of the new version, edit it to make any desired
changes, and then run:

`$ ./config.nice  
$ make  
$ make install  
$ PREFIX/bin/apachectl -k graceful-stop  
$ PREFIX/bin/apachectl -k start`

You should always test any new version in your
environment before putting it into production. For example, you
can install and run the new version along side the old one by
using a different `--prefix` and a
different port (by adjusting the `Listen` directive) to test for any
incompatibilities before doing the final upgrade.
