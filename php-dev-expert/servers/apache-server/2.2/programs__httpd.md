# httpd - Apache Hypertext Transfer Protocol Server

`httpd` is the Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) server program. It is designed to be run as a standalone
daemon process. When used like this it will create a pool of
child processes or threads to handle requests.

In general, `httpd` should not be invoked directly,
but rather should be invoked via `apachectl` on Unix-based systems or [as a service on Windows NT,
2000 and XP](platform__windows.md#winsvc) and [as
a console application on Windows 9x and ME](platform__windows.md#wincons).

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## Options

`-d serverroot`
:   Set the initial value for the `ServerRoot` directive to
    serverroot. This can be overridden by the ServerRoot
    directive in the configuration file. The default is
    `/usr/local/apache2`.

`-f config`
:   Uses the directives in the file config on startup. If
    config does not begin with a /, then it is taken to be a
    path relative to the `ServerRoot`. The default is
    `conf/httpd.conf`.

`-k start|restart|graceful|stop|graceful-stop`
:   Signals `httpd` to start, restart, or stop. See [Stopping Apache httpd](stopping.md) for more information.

`-C directive`
:   Process the configuration directive before reading
    config files.

`-c directive`
:   Process the configuration directive after reading config
    files.

`-D parameter`
:   Sets a configuration parameter which can be used with
    `<IfDefine>` sections
    in the configuration files to conditionally skip or process commands
    at server startup and restart. Also can be used to set certain
    less-common startup parameters including `-DNO_DETACH`
    (prevent the parent from forking) and `-DFOREGROUND`
    (prevent the parent from calling `setsid()` et al).

`-e level`
:   Sets the `LogLevel` to
    level during server startup. This is useful for
    temporarily increasing the verbosity of the error messages to find
    problems during startup.

`-E file`
:   Send error messages during server startup to file.

`-R directory`
:   When the server is compiled using the `SHARED_CORE`
    rule, this specifies the directory for the shared
    object files.

`-h`
:   Output a short summary of available command line options.

`-l`
:   Output a list of modules compiled into the server. This will
    **not** list dynamically loaded modules included using
    the `LoadModule` directive.

`-L`
:   Output a list of directives together with expected arguments and
    places where the directive is valid.

`-M`
:   Dump a list of loaded Static and Shared Modules.

`-S`
:   Show the settings as parsed from the config file (currently only
    shows the virtualhost settings).

`-T` (Available in 2.2.17 and later)
:   Skip document root check at startup/restart.

`-t`
:   Run syntax tests for configuration files only. The program
    immediately exits after these syntax parsing tests with either a return code
    of 0 (Syntax OK) or return code not equal to 0 (Syntax Error). If -D
    DUMP\_VHOSTS is also set, details of the virtual host
    configuration will be printed. If -D DUMP\_MODULES  is
    set, all loaded modules will be printed.

`-v`
:   Print the version of `httpd`, and then exit.

`-V`
:   Print the version and build parameters of `httpd`, and
    then exit.

`-X`
:   Run httpd in debug mode. Only one worker will be started and the
    server will not detach from the console.

The following arguments are available only on the [Windows platform](platform__windows.md):

`-k install|config|uninstall`
:   Install Apache httpd as a Windows NT service; change startup options for
    the Apache httpd service; and uninstall the Apache httpd service.

`-n name`
:   The name of the Apache httpd service to signal.

`-w`
:   Keep the console window open on error so that the error message can
    be read.
