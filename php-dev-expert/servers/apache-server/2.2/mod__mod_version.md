### Summary

This module is designed for the use in test suites and large
networks which have to deal with different httpd versions and
different configurations. It provides a new container -- `<IfVersion>`, which
allows a flexible version checking including numeric comparisons and
regular expressions.

### Examples

`<IfVersion 2.1.0>  

# current httpd version is exactly 2.1.0  
</IfVersion>  
  
<IfVersion >= 2.2>  

# use really new features :-)  
</IfVersion>`

See below for further possibilities.

## <IfVersion> Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | contains version dependent configuration |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `<IfVersion [[!]operator] version> ... </IfVersion>` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | All |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_version |

The `<IfVersion>` section encloses
configuration directives which are executed only if the
`httpd` version
matches the desired criteria. For normal (numeric) comparisons the
version argument has the format
`major[.minor[.patch]]`, e.g.
`2.1.0` or `2.2`. minor and
patch are optional. If these numbers are omitted, they are
assumed to be zero. The following numerical operators are
possible:

| operator | description |
| --- | --- |
| `=` or `==` | httpd version is equal |
| `>` | httpd version is greater than |
| `>=` | httpd version is greater or equal |
| `<` | httpd version is less than |
| `<=` | httpd version is less or equal |

### Example

`<IfVersion >= 2.1>  

# this happens only in versions greater or  
# equal 2.1.0.  
</IfVersion>`

Besides the numerical comparison it is possible to match a
[regular expression](glossary.md#regex "see glossary")
against the httpd version. There are two ways to write it:

| operator | description |
| --- | --- |
| `=` or `==` | version has the form `/regex/` |
| `~` | version has the form `regex` |

### Example

`<IfVersion = /^2.1.[01234]$/>  

# e.g. workaround for buggy versions
</IfVersion>`

In order to reverse the meaning, all operators can be preceded by an
exclamation mark (`!`):

`<IfVersion !~ ^2.1.[01234]$>  

# not for those versions  
</IfVersion>`

If the operator is omitted, it is assumed to be
`=`.
