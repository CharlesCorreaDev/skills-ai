### Summary

This module provides for flexible logging of client
requests. Logs are written in a customizable format, and may be
written directly to a file, or to an external program.
Conditional logging is provided so that individual requests may
be included or excluded from the logs based on characteristics
of the request.

Three directives are provided by this module:
`TransferLog` to create
a log file, `LogFormat`
to set a custom format, and `CustomLog` to define a log file and format in one
step. The `TransferLog` and `CustomLog` directives can be used multiple times in each
server to cause each request to be logged to multiple files.

## Custom Log Formats

The format argument to the `LogFormat` and `CustomLog` directives is a string. This string is
used to log each request to the log file. It can contain literal
characters copied into the log files and the C-style control
characters "\n" and "\t" to represent new-lines and tabs.
Literal quotes and backslashes should be escaped with
backslashes.

The characteristics of the request itself are logged by
placing "`%`" directives in the format string, which are
replaced in the log file by the values as follows:

| Format String | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `%%` | The percent sign |
| `%a` | Remote IP-address |
| `%A` | Local IP-address |
| `%B` | Size of response in bytes, excluding HTTP headers. |
| `%b` | Size of response in bytes, excluding HTTP headers. In CLF format, *i.e.* a '`-`' rather than a 0 when no bytes are sent. |
| `%{Foobar}C` | The contents of cookie Foobar in the request sent to the server. Only version 0 cookies are fully supported. |
| `%D` | The time taken to serve the request, in microseconds. |
| `%{FOOBAR}e` | The contents of the environment variable FOOBAR |
| `%f` | Filename |
| `%h` | Remote host |
| `%H` | The request protocol |
| `%{Foobar}i` | The contents of `Foobar:` header line(s) in the request sent to the server. Changes made by other modules (e.g. `mod_headers`) affect this. If you're interested in what the request header was prior to when most modules would have modified it, use `mod_setenvif` to copy the header into an internal environment variable and log that value with the `%{VARNAME}e` described above. |
| `%k` | Number of keepalive requests handled on this connection. Interesting if `KeepAlive` is being used, so that, for example, a '1' means the first keepalive request after the initial one, '2' the second, etc...; otherwise this is always 0 (indicating the initial request). Available in versions 2.2.11 and later. |
| `%l` | Remote logname (from identd, if supplied). This will return a dash unless `mod_ident` is present and `IdentityCheck` is set `On`. |
| `%m` | The request method |
| `%{Foobar}n` | The contents of note Foobar from another module. |
| `%{Foobar}o` | The contents of `Foobar:` header line(s) in the reply. |
| `%p` | The canonical port of the server serving the request |
| `%{format}p` | The canonical port of the server serving the request or the server's actual port or the client's actual port. Valid formats are `canonical`, `local`, or `remote`. |
| `%P` | The process ID of the child that serviced the request. |
| `%{format}P` | The process ID or thread id of the child that serviced the request. Valid formats are `pid`, `tid`, and `hextid`. `hextid` requires APR 1.2.0 or higher. |
| `%q` | The query string (prepended with a `?` if a query string exists, otherwise an empty string) |
| `%r` | First line of request |
| `%R` | The handler generating the response (if any). |
| `%s` | Status. For requests that got internally redirected, this is the status of the \*original\* request --- `%>s` for the last. |
| `%t` | Time the request was received (standard english format) |
| `%{format}t` | The time, in the form given by format, which should be in an extended `strftime(3)` format (potentially localized). If the format starts with `begin:` (default) the time is taken at the beginning of the request processing. If it starts with `end:` it is the time when the log entry gets written, close to the end of the request processing. In addition to the formats supported by `strftime(3)`, the following format tokens are supported:  |  |  | | --- | --- | | `sec` | number of seconds since the Epoch | | `msec` | number of milliseconds since the Epoch | | `usec` | number of microseconds since the Epoch | | `msec_frac` | millisecond fraction | | `usec_frac` | microsecond fraction |  These tokens can not be combined with each other or `strftime(3)` formatting in the same format string. You can use multiple `%{format}t` tokens instead. The extended `strftime(3)` tokens are available in 2.2.30 and later. |
| `%T` | The time taken to serve the request, in seconds. |
| `%{UNIT}T` | The time taken to serve the request, in a time unit given by `UNIT`. Valid units are `ms` for milliseconds, `us` for microseconds, and `s` for seconds. Using `s` gives the same result as `%T` without any format; using `us` gives the same result as `%D`. Combining `%T` with a unit is available in 2.2.30 and later. |
| `%u` | Remote user (from auth; may be bogus if return status (`%s`) is 401) |
| `%U` | The URL path requested, not including any query string. |
| `%v` | The canonical `ServerName` of the server serving the request. |
| `%V` | The server name according to the `UseCanonicalName` setting. |
| `%X` | Connection status when response is completed:  |  |  | | --- | --- | | `X` = | connection aborted before the response completed. | | `+` = | connection may be kept alive after the response is sent. | | `-` = | connection will be closed after the response is sent. |   (This directive was `%c` in late versions of Apache 1.3, but this conflicted with the historical ssl `%{var}c` syntax.) |
| `%I` | Bytes received, including request and headers, cannot be zero. You need to enable `mod_logio` to use this. |
| `%O` | Bytes sent, including headers, cannot be zero. You need to enable `mod_logio` to use this. |
| `%{VARNAME}^ti` | The contents of `VARNAME:` trailer line(s) in the request sent to the server. |
| `%{VARNAME}^to` | The contents of `VARNAME:` trailer line(s) in the response sent from the server. |

### Modifiers

Particular items can be restricted to print only for
responses with specific HTTP status codes by placing a
comma-separated list of status codes immediately following the
"%". For example, `"%400,501{User-agent}i"` logs
`User-agent` on 400 errors and 501 errors only. For
other status codes, the literal string `"-"` will be
logged. The status code list may be preceded by a
"`!`" to indicate negation:
`"%!200,304,302{Referer}i"` logs `Referer`
on all requests that do *not* return one of the three
specified codes.

The modifiers "<" and ">" can be used for requests that
have been internally redirected to choose whether the original
or final (respectively) request should be consulted. By
default, the `%` directives `%s, %U, %T,
%D,` and `%r` look at the original request
while all others look at the final request. So for example,
`%>s` can be used to record the final status of
the request and `%<u` can be used to record the
original authenticated user on a request that is internally
redirected to an unauthenticated resource.

### Some Notes

For security reasons, starting with version 2.0.46,
non-printable and other special characters in `%r`,
`%i` and `%o` are escaped using
`\xhh` sequences, where hh
stands for the hexadecimal representation of the raw
byte. Exceptions from this rule are `"` and
`\`, which are escaped by prepending a backslash, and
all whitespace characters, which are written in their C-style
notation (`\n`, `\t`, etc). In versions
prior to 2.0.46, no escaping was performed on these strings so
you had to be quite careful when dealing with raw log files.

In httpd 2.0, unlike 1.3, the `%b` and
`%B` format strings do not represent the number of
bytes sent to the client, but simply the size in bytes of the
HTTP response (which will differ, for instance, if the
connection is aborted, or if SSL is used). The `%O`
format provided by `mod_logio` will log the
actual number of bytes sent over the network.

Note: `mod_cache` is implemented as a
quick-handler and not as a standard handler. Therefore, the
`%R` format string will not return any handler
information when content caching is involved.

### Examples

Some commonly used log format strings are:

Common Log Format (CLF)
:   `"%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b"`

Common Log Format with Virtual Host
:   `"%v %h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b"`

NCSA extended/combined log format
:   `"%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\"
    \"%{User-agent}i\""`

Referer log format
:   `"%{Referer}i -> %U"`

Agent (Browser) log format
:   `"%{User-agent}i"`

You can use the `%{format}t` directive multiple
times to build up a time format using the extended format tokens
like `msec_frac`:

Timestamp including milliseconds
:   `"%{%d/%b/%Y %T}t.%{msec_frac}t %{%z}t"`

## Security Considerations

See the [security tips](misc__security_tips.md#serverroot)
document for details on why your security could be compromised
if the directory where logfiles are stored is writable by
anyone other than the user that starts the server.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## BufferedLogs Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Buffer log entries in memory before writing to disk |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `BufferedLogs On|Off` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `BufferedLogs Off` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_log\_config |
| [Compatibility:](mod__directive-dict.md#Compatibility) | Available in versions 2.0.41 and later. |

The `BufferedLogs` directive causes
`mod_log_config` to store several log entries in
memory and write them together to disk, rather than writing them
after each request. On some systems, this may result in more
efficient disk access and hence higher performance. It may be
set only once for the entire server; it cannot be configured
per virtual-host.

This directive is experimental and should be used with
caution.

## CookieLog Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Sets filename for the logging of cookies |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `CookieLog filename` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_log\_config |
| [Compatibility:](mod__directive-dict.md#Compatibility) | This directive is deprecated. |

The `CookieLog` directive sets the
filename for logging of cookies. The filename is relative to the
`ServerRoot`. This directive is
included only for compatibility with `mod_cookies`,
and is deprecated.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## CustomLog Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Sets filename and format of log file |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `CustomLog file|pipe format|nickname [env=[!]environment-variable]` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_log\_config |

The `CustomLog` directive is used to
log requests to the server. A log format is specified, and the
logging can optionally be made conditional on request
characteristics using environment variables.

The first argument, which specifies the location to which
the logs will be written, can take one of the following two
types of values:

file
:   A filename, relative to the `ServerRoot`.

pipe
:   The pipe character "`|`", followed by the path
    to a program to receive the log information on its standard
    input. See the notes on [piped logs](logs.md#piped)
    for more information.

    ### Security:

    If a program is used, then it will be run as the user who
    started `httpd`. This will be root if the server was
    started by root; be sure that the program is secure.

    ### Note

    When entering a file path on non-Unix platforms, care should be taken
    to make sure that only forward slashed are used even though the platform
    may allow the use of back slashes. In general it is a good idea to always
    use forward slashes throughout the configuration files.

The second argument specifies what will be written to the
log file. It can specify either a nickname defined by
a previous `LogFormat`
directive, or it can be an explicit format string as
described in the [log formats](#formats) section.

For example, the following two sets of directives have
exactly the same effect:

`# CustomLog with format nickname  
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b" common  
CustomLog logs/access_log common  
  
# CustomLog with explicit format string  
CustomLog logs/access_log "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b"`

The third argument is optional and controls whether or
not to log a particular request based on the
presence or absence of a particular variable in the server
environment. If the specified [environment
variable](env.md) is set for the request (or is not set, in the case
of a '`env=!name`' clause), then the
request will be logged.

Environment variables can be set on a per-request
basis using the `mod_setenvif`
and/or `mod_rewrite` modules. For
example, if you want to record requests for all GIF
images on your server in a separate logfile but not in your main
log, you can use:

`SetEnvIf Request_URI \.gif$ gif-image  
CustomLog gif-requests.log common env=gif-image  
CustomLog nongif-requests.log common env=!gif-image`

Or, to reproduce the behavior of the old RefererIgnore
directive, you might use the following:

`SetEnvIf Referer example\.com localreferer  
CustomLog referer.log referer env=!localreferer`

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## LogFormat Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Describes a format for use in a log file |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `LogFormat format|nickname [nickname]` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b"` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_log\_config |

This directive specifies the format of the access log
file.

The `LogFormat` directive can take one of two
forms. In the first form, where only one argument is specified,
this directive sets the log format which will be used by logs
specified in subsequent `TransferLog`
directives. The single argument can specify an explicit
format as discussed in the [custom log
formats](#formats) section above. Alternatively, it can use a
nickname to refer to a log format defined in a
previous `LogFormat` directive as described
below.

The second form of the `LogFormat`
directive associates an explicit format with a
nickname. This nickname can then be used in
subsequent `LogFormat` or
`CustomLog` directives
rather than repeating the entire format string. A
`LogFormat` directive that defines a nickname
**does nothing else** -- that is, it *only*
defines the nickname, it doesn't actually apply the format and make
it the default. Therefore, it will not affect subsequent
`TransferLog` directives.
In addition, `LogFormat` cannot use one nickname
to define another nickname. Note that the nickname should not contain
percent signs (`%`).

### Example

`LogFormat "%v %h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b" vhost_common`

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## TransferLog Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Specify location of a log file |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `TransferLog file|pipe` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_log\_config |

This directive has exactly the same arguments and effect as
the `CustomLog`
directive, with the exception that it does not allow the log format
to be specified explicitly or for conditional logging of requests.
Instead, the log format is determined by the most recently specified
`LogFormat` directive
which does not define a nickname. Common Log Format is used if no
other format has been specified.

### Example

`LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\""  
TransferLog logs/access_log`
