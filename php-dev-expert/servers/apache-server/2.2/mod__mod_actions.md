# Apache Module mod\_actions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__module-dict.md#Description) | This module provides for executing CGI scripts based on media type or request method. |
| [Status:](mod__module-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module Identifier:](mod__module-dict.md#ModuleIdentifier) | actions\_module |
| [Source File:](mod__module-dict.md#SourceFile) | mod\_actions.c |

### Summary

This module has two directives. The `Action` directive lets you run CGI
scripts whenever a file of a certain [MIME content type](glossary.md#mime-type "see glossary") is requested. The
`Script` directive lets
you run CGI scripts whenever a particular method is used in a
request. This makes it much easier to execute scripts that process
files.

## Action Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Activates a CGI script for a particular handler or content-type |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `Action action-type cgi-script [virtual]` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_actions |
| [Compatibility:](mod__directive-dict.md#Compatibility) | The `virtual` modifier and handler passing were introduced in Apache 2.1 |

This directive adds an action, which will activate
cgi-script when action-type is triggered by
the request. The cgi-script is the URL-path to a
resource that has been designated as a CGI script using `ScriptAlias` or `AddHandler`. The
action-type can be either a [handler](handler.md) or a [MIME content type](glossary.md#mime-type "see glossary"). It sends the URL and
file path of the requested document using the standard CGI
`PATH_INFO` and `PATH_TRANSLATED`
environment variables. The handler used for the particular request
is passed using the `REDIRECT_HANDLER` variable.

### Examples

`# Requests for files of a particular MIME content type:  
Action image/gif /cgi-bin/images.cgi  
  
# Files of a particular file extension  
AddHandler my-file-type .xyz  
Action my-file-type /cgi-bin/program.cgi`

In the first example, requests for files with a MIME content
type of `image/gif` will be handled by the
specified cgi script `/cgi-bin/images.cgi`.

In the second example, requests for files with a file extension of
`.xyz` are handled by the specified cgi script
`/cgi-bin/program.cgi`.

The optional `virtual` modifier turns off the check
whether the requested file really exists. This is useful, for example,
if you want to use the `Action` directive in
virtual locations.

### Example

`<Location /news>  

SetHandler news-handler  
Action news-handler /cgi-bin/news.cgi virtual  
</Location>`

- `AddHandler`

## Script Directive

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Activates a CGI script for a particular request method. |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `Script method cgi-script` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Base |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_actions |

This directive adds an action, which will activate
cgi-script when a file is requested using the method of
method. The cgi-script is the URL-path to a
resource that has been designated as a CGI script using `ScriptAlias` or `AddHandler`. The URL and
file path of the requested document is sent using the standard CGI
`PATH_INFO` and `PATH_TRANSLATED` environment
variables.

Any arbitrary method name may be used. **Method names are
case-sensitive**, so `Script PUT` and
`Script put` have two entirely different
effects.

Note that the `Script` command defines default
actions only. If a CGI script is called, or some other resource that is
capable of handling the requested method internally, it will do
so. Also note that `Script` with a method of
`GET` will only be called if there are query arguments present
(*e.g.*, foo.html?hi). Otherwise, the request will
proceed normally.

### Examples

`# For <ISINDEX>-style searching  
Script GET /cgi-bin/search  
  
# A CGI PUT handler  
Script PUT /~bob/put.cgi`
