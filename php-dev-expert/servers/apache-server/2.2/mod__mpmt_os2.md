### Summary

The Server consists of a main, parent process and a small, static
number of child processes.

The parent process's job is to manage the child processes. This
involves spawning children as required to ensure there are always
`StartServers` processes
accepting connections.

Each child process consists of a a pool of worker threads and a
main thread that accepts connections and passes them to the workers via
a work queue. The worker thread pool is dynamic, managed by a
maintenance thread so that the number of idle threads is kept between
`MinSpareThreads` and
`MaxSpareThreads`.
