# Glossary

This glossary defines some of the common terminology related to Apache HTTP Server in
particular, and web serving in general. More information on each concept
is provided in the links.

## Definitions [¶](#definitions "Permanent link")

Access Control
:   The restriction of access to network realms. In an httpd context
    usually the restriction of access to certain *URLs*.  
     See: [Authentication, Authorization, and Access
    Control](howto__auth.md)

Algorithm
:   An unambiguous formula or set of rules for solving a problem in a finite
    number of steps. Algorithms for encryption are usually called
    Ciphers.

APache eXtension Tool (apxs)
:   A perl script that aids in compiling [module](glossary.md#module "see glossary") sources into Dynamic Shared Objects
    ([DSO](glossary.md#dso "see glossary")s) and helps install them in the
    httpd web server.  
    See: Manual Page: `apxs`

Apache Portable Runtime (APR)
:   A set of libraries providing many of the basic interfaces
    between the server and the operating system. APR is developed
    parallel to the Apache HTTP Server as an independent project.  
    See: [Apache Portable Runtime
    Project](http://apr.apache.org/)

Authentication
:   The positive identification of a network entity such as a server, a
    client, or a user.  
    See: [Authentication, Authorization, and Access
    Control](howto__auth.md)

Certificate
:   A data record used for authenticating network entities such
    as a server or a client. A certificate contains X.509 information pieces
    about its owner (called the subject) and the signing [Certification Authority](glossary.md#certificationauthority "see glossary") (called
    the issuer), plus the owner's [public
    key](glossary.md#publickey "see glossary") and the
    signature made by the CA. Network entities verify these signatures
    using CA certificates.  
    See: [SSL/TLS Encryption](ssl.md)

Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
:   An unsigned [certificate](glossary.md#certificate "see glossary") for
    submission to a [Certification
    Authority](glossary.md#certificationauthority "see glossary"), which signs it with the [Private Key](glossary.md#privatekey "see glossary") of their CA
    *Certificate*. Once the CSR is signed, it becomes a real
    certificate.  
    See: [SSL/TLS Encryption](ssl.md)

Certification Authority (CA)
:   A trusted third party whose purpose is to sign certificates for network
    entities it has authenticated using secure means. Other network entities
    can check the signature to verify that a CA has authenticated the bearer
    of a certificate.  
    See: [SSL/TLS Encryption](ssl.md)

Cipher
:   An algorithm or system for data encryption. Examples are DES, IDEA, RC4,
    etc.  
    See: [SSL/TLS Encryption](ssl.md)

Ciphertext
:   The result after [Plaintext](glossary.md#plaintext "see glossary") is
    passed through a [Cipher](glossary.md#cipher "see glossary").  
     See: [SSL/TLS Encryption](ssl.md)

Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
:   A standard definition for an interface between a web server and an
    external program that allows the external program to service requests.
    There is an Informational RFC ([RFC 3875](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3875)) which covers the specifics.  
    See: [Dynamic Content with CGI](howto__cgi.md)

Configuration Directive
:   See: [Directive](glossary.md#directive "see glossary")

Configuration File
:   A text file containing [Directives](glossary.md#directive "see glossary")
    that control the configuration of httpd.  
    See: [Configuration Files](configuring.md)

CONNECT
:   An HTTP [method](glossary.md#method "see glossary") for proxying raw data
    channels over HTTP. It can be used to encapsulate other protocols, such as
    the SSL protocol.

Context
:   An area in the [configuration
    files](glossary.md#configurationfile "see glossary") where certain types of [directives](glossary.md#directive "see glossary") are allowed.  
    See: [Terms Used to Describe
    httpd Directives](mod__directive-dict.md#Context)

Digital Signature
:   An encrypted text block that validates a certificate or other file. A
    [Certification Authority](glossary.md#certificationauthority "see glossary")
    creates a signature by generating a hash of the *Public Key*
    embedded in a *Certificate*, then encrypting the hash with its own
    *Private Key*. Only the CA's public key can decrypt the signature,
    verifying that the CA has authenticated the network entity that owns the
    *Certificate*.  
    See: [SSL/TLS Encryption](ssl.md)

Directive
:   A configuration command that controls one or more aspects of httpd's
    behavior. Directives are placed in the [Configuration File](glossary.md#configurationfile "see glossary")  
    See: [Directive Index](mod__directives.md)

Dynamic Shared Object (DSO)
:   [Modules](glossary.md#module "see glossary") compiled separately from the
    Apache `httpd` binary that can be loaded on-demand.  
    See: [Dynamic Shared Object Support](dso.md)

Environment Variable (env-variable)
:   Named variables managed by the operating system shell and used to store
    information and communicate between programs. httpd also contains
    internal variables that are referred to as environment variables, but are
    stored in internal httpd structures, rather than in the shell
    environment.  
    See: [Environment Variables in Apache httpd](env.md)

Export-Crippled
:   Diminished in cryptographic strength (and security) in order to comply
    with the United States' Export Administration Regulations (EAR).
    Export-crippled cryptographic software is limited to a small key size,
    resulting in *Ciphertext* which usually can be decrypted by brute
    force.  
    See: [SSL/TLS Encryption](ssl.md)

Filter
:   A process that is applied to data that is sent or received by the
    server. Input filters process data sent by the client to the server,
    while output filters process documents on the server before they are sent
    to the client. For example, the `INCLUDES` output filter
    processes documents for [Server Side
    Includes](glossary.md#ssi "see glossary").  
    See: [Filters](filter.md)

Fully-Qualified Domain-Name (FQDN)
:   The unique name of a network entity, consisting of a hostname and a
    domain name that can resolve to an IP address. For example,
    `www` is a hostname, `example.com` is a domain name,
    and `www.example.com` is a fully-qualified domain name.

Handler
:   An internal httpd representation of the action to be performed when a
    file is called. Generally, files have implicit handlers, based on the file
    type. Normally, all files are simply served by the server, but certain
    file types are "handled" separately. For example, the
    `cgi-script` handler designates files to be processed as
    [CGIs](glossary.md#cgi "see glossary").  
    See: [httpd's Handler Use](handler.md)

Hash
:   A mathematical one-way, irreversible algorithm generating a string with
    fixed-length from another string of any length. Different input strings
    will usually produce different hashes (depending on the hash function).

Header
:   The part of the [HTTP](glossary.md#http "see glossary") request and
    response that is sent before the actual content, and that contains
    meta-information describing the content.

.htaccess
:   A [configuration file](glossary.md#configurationfile "see glossary") that
    is placed inside the web tree and applies configuration [directives](glossary.md#directive "see glossary") to the directory where it is
    placed and all sub-directories. Despite its name, this file can hold
    almost any type of directive, not just access-control directives.  
    See: [Configuration Files](configuring.md)

httpd.conf
:   The main httpd [configuration
    file](glossary.md#configurationfile "see glossary"). The default location is
    `/usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf`, but it may be moved using
    run-time or compile-time configuration.  
    See: [Configuration Files](configuring.md)

HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
:   The standard transmission protocol used on the World Wide Web. httpd
    implements version 1.1 of the protocol, referred to as HTTP/1.1 and
    defined by [RFC 2616](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616).

HTTPS
:   The HyperText Transfer Protocol (Secure), the standard encrypted
    communication mechanism on the World Wide Web. This is actually just HTTP
    over [SSL](glossary.md#ssl "see glossary").  
    See: [SSL/TLS Encryption](ssl.md)

Method
:   In the context of [HTTP](glossary.md#http "see glossary"), an action to
    perform on a resource, specified on the request line by the client. Some
    of the methods available in HTTP are `GET`, `POST`,
    and `PUT`.

Message Digest
:   A hash of a message, which can be used to verify that the contents of
    the message have not been altered in transit.  
    See: [SSL/TLS Encryption](ssl.md)

MIME-type
:   A way to describe the kind of document being transmitted. Its name
    comes from that fact that its format is borrowed from the Multipurpose
    Internet Mail Extensions. It consists of a major type and a minor type,
    separated by a slash. Some examples are `text/html`,
    `image/gif`, and `application/octet-stream`. In
    HTTP, the MIME-type is transmitted in the `Content-Type`
    [header](glossary.md#header "see glossary").  
    See: [mod\_mime](mod__mod_mime.md)

Module
:   An independent part of a program. Much of httpd's functionality is
    contained in modules that you can choose to include or exclude. Modules
    that are compiled into the `httpd` binary are
    called static modules, while modules that are stored
    separately and can be optionally loaded at run-time are called
    dynamic modules or [DSOs](glossary.md#dso "see glossary").
    Modules that are included by default
    are called base modules. Many modules are available for httpd
    that are not distributed as part of the Apache HTTP Server [tarball](glossary.md#tarball "see glossary"). These are referred to as
    third-party modules.  
    See: [Module Index](mod.md)

Module Magic Number (MMN)
:   Module Magic Number is a constant defined in the httpd source code that
    is associated with binary compatibility of modules. It is changed when
    internal httpd structures, function calls and other significant parts of
    API change in such a way that binary compatibility cannot be guaranteed
    any more. On MMN change, all third party modules have to be at least
    recompiled, sometimes even slightly changed in order to work with the new
    version of httpd.

OpenSSL
:   The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS  
    See <http://www.openssl.org/>#

Pass Phrase
:   The word or phrase that protects private key files. It prevents
    unauthorized users from encrypting them. Usually it's just the secret
    encryption/decryption key used for [Ciphers](glossary.md#cipher "see glossary").  
    See: [SSL/TLS Encryption](ssl.md)

Per-directory Context
:   A [directive](glossary.md#directive "see glossary") is in
    per-directory context when it appears in a `<Directory>`, `<DirectoryMatch>`, `<Files>`, or `<FilesMatch>` section in the main
    configuration files, or in a `.htaccess` file.
    In per-directory context, directives apply only to the
    directory (or set of files) they are associated with.  
    See: [Configuration Sections](sections.md)

Plaintext
:   The unencrypted text.

Private Key
:   The secret key in a [Public Key
    Cryptography](glossary.md#publickeycryptography "see glossary") system, used to decrypt incoming messages and
    sign outgoing ones.  
    See: [SSL/TLS Encryption](ssl.md)

Proxy
:   An intermediate server that sits between the client and the *origin
    server*. It accepts requests from clients, transmits those requests
    on to the origin server, and then returns the response from the origin
    server to the client. If several clients request the same content, the
    proxy can deliver that content from its cache, rather than requesting it
    from the origin server each time, thereby reducing response time.  
    See: [mod\_proxy](mod__mod_proxy.md)

Public Key
:   The publicly available key in a [Public Key Cryptography](glossary.md#publickeycryptography "see glossary") system,
    used to encrypt messages bound for its owner and to decrypt signatures
    made by its owner.  
    See: [SSL/TLS Encryption](ssl.md)

Public Key Cryptography
:   The study and application of asymmetric encryption systems, which use
    one key for encryption and another for decryption. A corresponding pair of
    such keys constitutes a key pair. Also called Asymmetric Cryptography.
      
    See: [SSL/TLS Encryption](ssl.md)

Regular Expression (Regex)
:   A way of describing a pattern in text - for example, "all the words that
    begin with the letter A" or "every 10-digit phone number" or even "Every
    sentence with two commas in it, and no capital letter Q". Regular
    expressions are useful in httpd because they let you apply certain
    attributes against collections of files or resources in very flexible ways
    - for example, all .gif and .jpg files under any "images" directory could
    be written as "`/images/.*(jpg|gif)$`". In places where
    regular expressions are used to replace strings, the special variables
    $1 ... $9 contain backreferences to the grouped parts (in parentheses) of
    the matched expression. The special variable $0 contains a backreference
    to the whole matched expression. To write a literal dollar sign in a
    replacement string, it can be escaped with a backslash. Historically, the
    variable & could be used as alias for $0 in some places. This is no
    longer possible since version 2.3.6. httpd uses Perl Compatible Regular
    Expressions provided by the [PCRE](http://www.pcre.org/)
    library. You can find more documentation about PCRE's regular expression
    syntax at that site, or at
    [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCRE).

Reverse Proxy
:   A [proxy](glossary.md#proxy "see glossary") server that appears to the client
    as if it is an *origin server*. This is useful to hide the real
    origin server from the client for security reasons, or to load balance.

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
:   A protocol created by Netscape Communications Corporation for general
    communication authentication and encryption over TCP/IP networks. The most
    popular usage is *HTTPS*, i.e. the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
    over SSL.  
    See: [SSL/TLS Encryption](ssl.md)

Server Name Indication (SNI)
:   An SSL function that allows passing the desired server
    hostname in the initial SSL handshake message, so that the web
    server can select the correct virtual host configuration to use
    in processing the SSL handshake. It was added to SSL starting
    with the TLS extensions, RFC 3546.   
    See: [the SSL FAQ](ssl__ssl_faq.md)
    and [RFC 3546](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3546)

Server Side Includes (SSI)
:   A technique for embedding processing directives inside HTML files.  
    See: [Introduction to Server Side Includes](howto__ssi.md)

Session
:   The context information of a communication in general.

SSLeay
:   The original SSL/TLS implementation library developed by Eric A.
    Young

Subrequest
:   httpd provides a subrequest API to modules that allows other
    filesystem or URL paths to be partially or fully evaluated by
    the server. Example consumers of this API are
    `DirectoryIndex`,
    `mod_autoindex`, and `mod_include`.

Symmetric Cryptography
:   The study and application of *Ciphers* that use a single secret key
    for both encryption and decryption operations.  
    See: [SSL/TLS Encryption](ssl.md)

Tarball
:   A package of files gathered together using the `tar` utility.
    httpd distributions are stored in compressed tar archives or using
    pkzip.

Transport Layer Security (TLS)
:   The successor protocol to SSL, created by the Internet Engineering Task
    Force (IETF) for general communication authentication and encryption over
    TCP/IP networks. TLS version 1 is nearly identical with SSL version 3.  
    See: [SSL/TLS Encryption](ssl.md)

Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
:   The name/address of a resource on the Internet. This is the common
    informal term for what is formally called a [Uniform Resource Identifier](glossary.md#uniformresourceidentifier "see glossary").
    URLs are usually made up of a scheme, like `http` or
    `https`, a hostname, and a path. A URL for this page might
    be `http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/glossary.html`.

Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
:   A compact string of characters for identifying an abstract or physical
    resource. It is formally defined by [RFC 2396](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2396). URIs used on the
    world-wide web are commonly referred to as [URLs](glossary.md#url "see glossary").

Virtual Hosting
:   Serving multiple websites using a single instance of httpd. *IP
    virtual hosting* differentiates between websites based on their IP
    address, while *name-based virtual hosting* uses only the name of the
    host and can therefore host many sites on the same IP address.  
    See: [httpd Virtual Host documentation](vhosts.md)

X.509
:   An authentication certificate scheme recommended by the International
    Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) which is used for SSL/TLS authentication.  
     See: [SSL/TLS Encryption](ssl.md)
