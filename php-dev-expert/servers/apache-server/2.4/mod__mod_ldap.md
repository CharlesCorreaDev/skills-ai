### Summary

This module was created to improve the performance of
websites relying on backend connections to LDAP servers. In
addition to the functions provided by the standard LDAP
libraries, this module adds an LDAP connection pool and an LDAP
shared memory cache.

To enable this module, LDAP support must be compiled into
apr-util. This is achieved by adding the `--with-ldap`
flag to the `configure` script when building
Apache.

SSL/TLS support is dependent on which LDAP toolkit has been
linked to [APR](glossary.md#apr "see glossary"). As of this writing, APR-util supports:
[OpenLDAP SDK](http://www.openldap.org/) (2.x or later),
[Mozilla LDAP SDK](https://wiki.mozilla.org/LDAP_C_SDK), native Solaris LDAP SDK (Mozilla based) or the
native Microsoft LDAP SDK. See the [APR](http://apr.apache.org)
website for details.

## Example Configuration [¶](#exampleconfig "Permanent link")

The following is an example configuration that uses
`mod_ldap` to increase the performance of HTTP Basic
authentication provided by `mod_authnz_ldap`.

```
# Enable the LDAP connection pool and shared
# memory cache. Enable the LDAP cache status
# handler. Requires that mod_ldap and mod_authnz_ldap
# be loaded. Change the "yourdomain.example.com" to
# match your domain.

LDAPSharedCacheSize 500000
LDAPCacheEntries 1024
LDAPCacheTTL 600
LDAPOpCacheEntries 1024
LDAPOpCacheTTL 600

<Location "/ldap-status">
    SetHandler ldap-status

    Require host yourdomain.example.com

    Satisfy any
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "LDAP Protected"
    AuthBasicProvider ldap
    AuthLDAPURL "ldap://127.0.0.1/dc=example,dc=com?uid?one"
    Require valid-user
</Location>
```

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## LDAP Connection Pool [¶](#pool "Permanent link")

LDAP connections are pooled from request to request. This
allows the LDAP server to remain connected and bound ready for
the next request, without the need to unbind/connect/rebind.
The performance advantages are similar to the effect of HTTP
keepalives.

On a busy server it is possible that many requests will try
and access the same LDAP server connection simultaneously.
Where an LDAP connection is in use, Apache will create a new
connection alongside the original one. This ensures that the
connection pool does not become a bottleneck.

There is no need to manually enable connection pooling in
the Apache configuration. Any module using this module for
access to LDAP services will share the connection pool.

LDAP connections can keep track of the ldap client
credentials used when binding to an LDAP server. These
credentials can be provided to LDAP servers that do not
allow anonymous binds during referral chasing. To control
this feature, see the
`LDAPReferrals` and
`LDAPReferralHopLimit`
directives. By default, this feature is enabled.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## LDAP Cache [¶](#cache "Permanent link")

For improved performance, `mod_ldap` uses an aggressive
caching strategy to minimize the number of times that the LDAP
server must be contacted. Caching can easily double or triple
the throughput of Apache when it is serving pages protected
with `mod_authnz_ldap`. In addition, the load on the LDAP server
will be significantly decreased.

`mod_ldap` supports two types of LDAP caching during
the search/bind phase with a *search/bind cache* and
during the compare phase with two *operation
caches*. Each LDAP URL that is used by the server has
its own set of these three caches.

### The Search/Bind Cache

The process of doing a search and then a bind is the
most time-consuming aspect of LDAP operation, especially if
the directory is large. The search/bind cache is used to
cache all searches that resulted in successful binds.
Negative results (*i.e.*, unsuccessful searches, or searches
that did not result in a successful bind) are not cached.
The rationale behind this decision is that connections with
invalid credentials are only a tiny percentage of the total
number of connections, so by not caching invalid
credentials, the size of the cache is reduced.

`mod_ldap` stores the username, the DN
retrieved, the password used to bind, and the time of the bind
in the cache. Whenever a new connection is initiated with the
same username, `mod_ldap` compares the password
of the new connection with the password in the cache. If the
passwords match, and if the cached entry is not too old,
`mod_ldap` bypasses the search/bind phase.

The search and bind cache is controlled with the `LDAPCacheEntries` and `LDAPCacheTTL` directives.

### Operation Caches

During attribute and distinguished name comparison
functions, `mod_ldap` uses two operation caches
to cache the compare operations. The first compare cache is
used to cache the results of compares done to test for LDAP
group membership. The second compare cache is used to cache
the results of comparisons done between distinguished
names.

Note that, when group membership is being checked, any sub-group
comparison results are cached to speed future sub-group comparisons.

The behavior of both of these caches is controlled with
the `LDAPOpCacheEntries`
and `LDAPOpCacheTTL`
directives.

### Monitoring the Cache

`mod_ldap` has a content handler that allows
administrators to monitor the cache performance. The name of
the content handler is `ldap-status`, so the
following directives could be used to access the
`mod_ldap` cache information:

```
<Location "/server/cache-info">
    SetHandler ldap-status
</Location>
```

By fetching the URL `http://servername/cache-info`,
the administrator can get a status report of every cache that is used
by `mod_ldap` cache. Note that if Apache does not
support shared memory, then each `httpd` instance has its
own cache, so reloading the URL will result in different
information each time, depending on which `httpd`
instance processes the request.

## Using SSL/TLS [¶](#usingssltls "Permanent link")

The ability to create an SSL and TLS connections to an LDAP server
is defined by the directives
`LDAPTrustedGlobalCert`,
`LDAPTrustedClientCert`
and `LDAPTrustedMode`.
These directives specify the CA and optional client certificates to be used,
as well as the type of encryption to be used on the connection (none, SSL or
TLS/STARTTLS).

```
# Establish an SSL LDAP connection on port 636. Requires that
# mod_ldap and mod_authnz_ldap be loaded. Change the
# "yourdomain.example.com" to match your domain.

LDAPTrustedGlobalCert CA_DER "/certs/certfile.der"

<Location "/protected">
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "LDAP Protected"
    AuthBasicProvider ldap
    AuthLDAPURL "ldaps://127.0.0.1/dc=example,dc=com?uid?one"
    Require valid-user
</Location>
```

```
# Establish a TLS LDAP connection on port 389. Requires that
# mod_ldap and mod_authnz_ldap be loaded. Change the
# "yourdomain.example.com" to match your domain.

LDAPTrustedGlobalCert CA_DER "/certs/certfile.der"

<Location "/protected">
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "LDAP Protected"
    AuthBasicProvider ldap
    AuthLDAPURL "ldap://127.0.0.1/dc=example,dc=com?uid?one" TLS
    Require valid-user
</Location>
```

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## SSL/TLS Certificates [¶](#settingcerts "Permanent link")

The different LDAP SDKs have widely different methods of setting
and handling both CA and client side certificates.

If you intend to use SSL or TLS, read this section CAREFULLY so as to
understand the differences between configurations on the different LDAP
toolkits supported.

### Netscape/Mozilla/iPlanet SDK

CA certificates are specified within a file called cert7.db.
The SDK will not talk to any LDAP server whose certificate was
not signed by a CA specified in this file. If
client certificates are required, an optional key3.db file may
be specified with an optional password. The secmod file can be
specified if required. These files are in the same format as
used by the Netscape Communicator or Mozilla web browsers. The easiest
way to obtain these files is to grab them from your browser
installation.

Client certificates are specified per connection using the
`LDAPTrustedClientCert`
directive by referring
to the certificate "nickname". An optional password may be
specified to unlock the certificate's private key.

The SDK supports SSL only. An attempt to use STARTTLS will cause
an error when an attempt is made to contact the LDAP server at
runtime.

```
# Specify a Netscape CA certificate file
LDAPTrustedGlobalCert CA_CERT7_DB "/certs/cert7.db"
# Specify an optional key3.db file for client certificate support
LDAPTrustedGlobalCert CERT_KEY3_DB "/certs/key3.db"
# Specify the secmod file if required
LDAPTrustedGlobalCert CA_SECMOD "/certs/secmod"
<Location "/protected">
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "LDAP Protected"
    AuthBasicProvider ldap
    LDAPTrustedClientCert CERT_NICKNAME <nickname> [password]
    AuthLDAPURL "ldaps://127.0.0.1/dc=example,dc=com?uid?one"
    Require valid-user
</Location>
```

### OpenLDAP SDK

One or more CA certificates must be specified for the OpenLDAP
SDK to work correctly. These certificates can be specified as
binary DER or Base64 (PEM) encoded files.

Both CA and client certificates may be specified globally
(`LDAPTrustedGlobalCert`) or
per-connection (`LDAPTrustedClientCert`).
When any settings are specified per-connection, the global
settings are superseded.

The documentation for the SDK claims to support both SSL and
STARTTLS, however STARTTLS does not seem to work on all versions
of the SDK. The SSL/TLS mode can be set using the
LDAPTrustedMode parameter. If an ldaps:// URL is specified,
SSL mode is forced. The OpenLDAP documentation notes that SSL
(ldaps://) support has been deprecated to be replaced with TLS,
although the SSL functionality still works.

```
# Specify two CA certificate files
LDAPTrustedGlobalCert CA_DER "/certs/cacert1.der"
LDAPTrustedGlobalCert CA_BASE64 "/certs/cacert2.pem"
<Location "/protected">
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "LDAP Protected"
    AuthBasicProvider ldap
    LDAPTrustedClientCert CERT_BASE64 "/certs/cert1.pem"
    LDAPTrustedClientCert KEY_BASE64 "/certs/key1.pem"
    # CA certs respecified due to per-directory client certs
    LDAPTrustedClientCert CA_DER "/certs/cacert1.der"
    LDAPTrustedClientCert CA_BASE64 "/certs/cacert2.pem"
    AuthLDAPURL "ldaps://127.0.0.1/dc=example,dc=com?uid?one"
    Require valid-user
</Location>
```

### Solaris SDK

SSL/TLS for the native Solaris LDAP libraries is not yet
supported. If required, install and use the OpenLDAP libraries
instead.

### Microsoft SDK

SSL/TLS certificate configuration for the native Microsoft
LDAP libraries is done inside the system registry, and no
configuration directives are required.

Both SSL and TLS are supported by using the ldaps:// URL
format, or by using the `LDAPTrustedMode` directive accordingly.

Note: The status of support for client certificates is not yet known
for this toolkit.

## LDAPCacheEntries Directive [¶](#ldapcacheentries "Permanent link")

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Maximum number of entries in the primary LDAP cache |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `LDAPCacheEntries number` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `LDAPCacheEntries 1024` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_ldap |

Specifies the maximum size of the primary LDAP cache. This
cache contains successful search/binds. Set it to 0 to turn off
search/bind caching. The default size is 1024 cached
searches.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## LDAPCacheTTL Directive [¶](#ldapcachettl "Permanent link")

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Time that cached items remain valid |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `LDAPCacheTTL seconds` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `LDAPCacheTTL 600` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_ldap |

Specifies the time (in seconds) that an item in the
search/bind cache remains valid. The default is 600 seconds (10
minutes).

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## LDAPConnectionPoolTTL Directive [¶](#ldapconnectionpoolttl "Permanent link")

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Discard backend connections that have been sitting in the connection pool too long |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `LDAPConnectionPoolTTL n` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `LDAPConnectionPoolTTL -1` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_ldap |
| [Compatibility:](mod__directive-dict.md#Compatibility) | Apache HTTP Server 2.3.12 and later |

Specifies the maximum age, in seconds, that a pooled LDAP connection can remain idle
and still be available for use. Connections are cleaned up when they are next needed,
not asynchronously.

A setting of 0 causes connections to never be saved in the backend
connection pool. The default value of -1, and any other negative value,
allows connections of any age to be reused.

For performance reasons, the reference time used by this directive is
based on when the LDAP connection is returned to the pool, not the time
of the last successful I/O with the LDAP server.

Since 2.4.10, new measures are in place to avoid the reference time
from being inflated by cache hits or slow requests. First, the reference
time is not updated if no backend LDAP connections were needed. Second,
the reference time uses the time the HTTP request was received instead
of the time the request is completed.

This timeout defaults to units of seconds, but accepts
suffixes for milliseconds (ms), minutes (min), and hours (h).

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## LDAPConnectionTimeout Directive [¶](#ldapconnectiontimeout "Permanent link")

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Specifies the socket connection timeout in seconds |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `LDAPConnectionTimeout seconds` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_ldap |

This directive configures the LDAP\_OPT\_NETWORK\_TIMEOUT (or LDAP\_OPT\_CONNECT\_TIMEOUT)
option in the underlying LDAP client library, when available. This value
typically controls how long the LDAP client library will wait for the TCP
connection to the LDAP server to complete.

If a connection is not successful with the timeout period, either an error will be
returned or the LDAP client library will attempt to connect to a secondary LDAP
server if one is specified (via a space-separated list of hostnames in the
`AuthLDAPURL`).

The default is 10 seconds, if the LDAP client library linked with the
server supports the LDAP\_OPT\_NETWORK\_TIMEOUT option.

LDAPConnectionTimeout is only available when the LDAP client library linked
with the server supports the LDAP\_OPT\_NETWORK\_TIMEOUT
(or LDAP\_OPT\_CONNECT\_TIMEOUT) option, and the ultimate behavior is
dictated entirely by the LDAP client library.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## LDAPLibraryDebug Directive [¶](#ldaplibrarydebug "Permanent link")

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Enable debugging in the LDAP SDK |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `LDAPLibraryDebug 7` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `disabled` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_ldap |

Turns on SDK-specific LDAP debug options that generally cause the LDAP
SDK to log verbose trace information to the main Apache error log.
The trace messages from the LDAP SDK provide gory details that
can be useful during debugging of connectivity problems with backend LDAP servers

This option is only configurable when Apache HTTP Server is linked with
an LDAP SDK that implements `LDAP_OPT_DEBUG` or
`LDAP_OPT_DEBUG_LEVEL`, such as OpenLDAP (a value of 7 is verbose)
or Tivoli Directory Server (a value of 65535 is verbose).

The logged information will likely contain plaintext credentials being used or
validated by LDAP authentication, so care should be taken in protecting and purging
the error log when this directive is used.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## LDAPOpCacheEntries Directive [¶](#ldapopcacheentries "Permanent link")

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Number of entries used to cache LDAP compare operations |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `LDAPOpCacheEntries number` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `LDAPOpCacheEntries 1024` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_ldap |

This specifies the number of entries `mod_ldap`
will use to cache LDAP compare operations. The default is 1024
entries. Setting it to 0 disables operation caching.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## LDAPOpCacheTTL Directive [¶](#ldapopcachettl "Permanent link")

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Time that entries in the operation cache remain valid |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `LDAPOpCacheTTL seconds` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `LDAPOpCacheTTL 600` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_ldap |

Specifies the time (in seconds) that entries in the
operation cache remain valid. The default is 600 seconds.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## LDAPReferralHopLimit Directive [¶](#ldapreferralhoplimit "Permanent link")

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | The maximum number of referral hops to chase before terminating an LDAP query. |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `LDAPReferralHopLimit number` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `SDK dependent, typically between 5 and 10` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | AuthConfig |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_ldap |

This directive, if enabled by the `LDAPReferrals` directive,
limits the number of referral hops that are followed before terminating an
LDAP query.

Support for this tunable is uncommon in LDAP SDKs.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## LDAPReferrals Directive [¶](#ldapreferrals "Permanent link")

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Enable referral chasing during queries to the LDAP server. |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `LDAPReferrals On|Off|default` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `LDAPReferrals On` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](mod__directive-dict.md#Override) | AuthConfig |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_ldap |
| [Compatibility:](mod__directive-dict.md#Compatibility) | The default parameter is available in Apache 2.4.7 and later |

Some LDAP servers divide their directory among multiple domains and use referrals
to direct a client when a domain boundary is crossed. This is similar to a HTTP redirect.
LDAP client libraries may or may not chase referrals by default. This directive
explicitly configures the referral chasing in the underlying SDK.

`LDAPReferrals` takes the following values:

"on"
:   When set to "on", the underlying SDK's referral chasing state
    is enabled, `LDAPReferralHopLimit` is used to
    override the SDK's hop limit, and an LDAP rebind callback is
    registered.

"off"
:   When set to "off", the underlying SDK's referral chasing state
    is disabled completely.

"default"
:   When set to "default", the underlying SDK's referral chasing state
    is not changed, `LDAPReferralHopLimit` is not
    used to override the SDK's hop limit, and no LDAP rebind callback is
    registered.

The directive `LDAPReferralHopLimit` works in conjunction with
this directive to limit the number of referral hops to follow before terminating the LDAP query.
When referral processing is enabled by a value of "On", client credentials will be provided,
via a rebind callback, for any LDAP server requiring them.

## LDAPRetries Directive [¶](#ldapretries "Permanent link")

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Configures the number of LDAP server retries. |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `LDAPRetries number-of-retries` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `LDAPRetries 3` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_ldap |

The server will retry failed LDAP requests up to
`LDAPRetries` times. Setting this
directive to 0 disables retries.

LDAP errors such as timeouts and refused connections are retryable.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## LDAPRetryDelay Directive [¶](#ldapretrydelay "Permanent link")

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Configures the delay between LDAP server retries. |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `LDAPRetryDelay seconds` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `LDAPRetryDelay 0` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_ldap |

If `LDAPRetryDelay` is set to a non-zero
value, the server will delay retrying an LDAP request for the
specified amount of time. Setting this directive to 0 will
result in any retry to occur without delay.

LDAP errors such as timeouts and refused connections are retryable.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## LDAPSharedCacheFile Directive [¶](#ldapsharedcachefile "Permanent link")

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Sets the shared memory cache file |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `LDAPSharedCacheFile directory-path/filename` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_ldap |

Specifies the directory path and file name of the shared memory
cache file. If not set, anonymous shared memory will be used if the
platform supports it.

## LDAPSharedCacheSize Directive [¶](#ldapsharedcachesize "Permanent link")

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Size in bytes of the shared-memory cache |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `LDAPSharedCacheSize bytes` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `LDAPSharedCacheSize 500000` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_ldap |

Specifies the number of bytes to allocate for the shared
memory cache. The default is 500kb. If set to 0, shared memory
caching will not be used and every HTTPD process will create its
own cache.

## LDAPTimeout Directive [¶](#ldaptimeout "Permanent link")

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Specifies the timeout for LDAP search and bind operations, in seconds |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `LDAPTimeout seconds` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `LDAPTimeout 60` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_ldap |
| [Compatibility:](mod__directive-dict.md#Compatibility) | Apache HTTP Server 2.3.5 and later |

This directive configures the timeout for bind and search operations, as well as
the LDAP\_OPT\_TIMEOUT option in the underlying LDAP client library, when available.

If the timeout expires, httpd will retry in case an existing connection has
been silently dropped by a firewall. However, performance will be much better if
the firewall is configured to send TCP RST packets instead of silently dropping
packets.

Timeouts for ldap compare operations requires an SDK with LDAP\_OPT\_TIMEOUT, such as OpenLDAP >= 2.4.4.

## LDAPTrustedClientCert Directive [¶](#ldaptrustedclientcert "Permanent link")

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Sets the file containing or nickname referring to a per connection client certificate. Not all LDAP toolkits support per connection client certificates. |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `LDAPTrustedClientCert type directory-path/filename/nickname [password]` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | directory, .htaccess |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_ldap |

It specifies the directory path, file name or nickname of a
per connection client certificate used when establishing an SSL
or TLS connection to an LDAP server. Different locations or
directories may have their own independent client certificate
settings. Some LDAP toolkits (notably Novell)
do not support per connection client certificates, and will throw an
error on LDAP server connection if you try to use this directive
(Use the `LDAPTrustedGlobalCert`
directive instead for Novell client
certificates - See the SSL/TLS certificate guide above for details).
The type specifies the kind of certificate parameter being
set, depending on the LDAP toolkit being used. Supported types are:

- CA\_DER - binary DER encoded CA certificate
- CA\_BASE64 - PEM encoded CA certificate
- CERT\_DER - binary DER encoded client certificate
- CERT\_BASE64 - PEM encoded client certificate
- CERT\_NICKNAME - Client certificate "nickname" (Netscape SDK)
- KEY\_DER - binary DER encoded private key
- KEY\_BASE64 - PEM encoded private key

## LDAPTrustedGlobalCert Directive [¶](#ldaptrustedglobalcert "Permanent link")

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Sets the file or database containing global trusted Certificate Authority or global client certificates |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `LDAPTrustedGlobalCert type directory-path/filename [password]` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_ldap |

It specifies the directory path and file name of the trusted CA
certificates and/or system wide client certificates `mod_ldap`
should use when establishing an SSL or TLS connection to an LDAP
server. Note that all certificate information specified using this directive
is applied globally to the entire server installation. Some LDAP toolkits
(notably Novell) require all client certificates to be set globally using
this directive. Most other toolkits require clients certificates to be set
per Directory or per Location using `LDAPTrustedClientCert`. If you get this
wrong, an error may be logged when an attempt is made to contact the LDAP
server, or the connection may silently fail (See the SSL/TLS certificate
guide above for details).
The type specifies the kind of certificate parameter being
set, depending on the LDAP toolkit being used. Supported types are:

- CA\_DER - binary DER encoded CA certificate
- CA\_BASE64 - PEM encoded CA certificate
- CA\_CERT7\_DB - Netscape cert7.db CA certificate database file
- CA\_SECMOD - Netscape secmod database file
- CERT\_DER - binary DER encoded client certificate
- CERT\_BASE64 - PEM encoded client certificate
- CERT\_KEY3\_DB - Netscape key3.db client certificate database file
- CERT\_NICKNAME - Client certificate "nickname" (Netscape SDK)
- CERT\_PFX - PKCS#12 encoded client certificate
- KEY\_DER - binary DER encoded private key
- KEY\_BASE64 - PEM encoded private key
- KEY\_PFX - PKCS#12 encoded private key

## LDAPTrustedMode Directive [¶](#ldaptrustedmode "Permanent link")

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Specifies the SSL/TLS mode to be used when connecting to an LDAP server. |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `LDAPTrustedMode type` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_ldap |

The following modes are supported:

- NONE - no encryption
- SSL - ldaps:// encryption on default port 636
- TLS - STARTTLS encryption on default port 389

Not all LDAP toolkits support all the above modes. An error message
will be logged at runtime if a mode is not supported, and the
connection to the LDAP server will fail.

If an ldaps:// URL is specified, the mode becomes SSL and the setting
of `LDAPTrustedMode` is ignored.

## LDAPVerifyServerCert Directive [¶](#ldapverifyservercert "Permanent link")

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Description:](mod__directive-dict.md#Description) | Force server certificate verification |
| [Syntax:](mod__directive-dict.md#Syntax) | `LDAPVerifyServerCert On|Off` |
| [Default:](mod__directive-dict.md#Default) | `LDAPVerifyServerCert On` |
| [Context:](mod__directive-dict.md#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](mod__directive-dict.md#Status) | Extension |
| [Module:](mod__directive-dict.md#Module) | mod\_ldap |

Specifies whether to force the verification of a
server certificate when establishing an SSL connection to the
LDAP server.
