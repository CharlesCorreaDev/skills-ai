# Expressions in Apache HTTP Server

Historically, there are several syntax variants for expressions
used to express a condition in the different modules of the Apache
HTTP Server. There is some ongoing effort to only use a single
variant, called *ap\_expr*, for all configuration directives.
This document describes the *ap\_expr* expression parser.

The *ap\_expr* expression is intended to replace most other
expression variants in HTTPD. For example, the deprecated `SSLRequire` expressions can be replaced
by [Require expr](mod__mod_authz_core.md#reqexpr).

## Grammar in Backus-Naur Form notation [¶](#grammar "Permanent link")

[Backus-Naur
Form](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form) (BNF) is a notation technique for context-free grammars,
often used to describe the syntax of languages used in computing.
In most cases, expressions are used to express boolean values.
For these, the starting point in the BNF is `expr`.
However, a few directives like `LogMessage` accept expressions
that evaluate to a string value. For those, the starting point in
the BNF is `string`.

>               | expr "&&" expr

## Variables [¶](#vars "Permanent link")

The expression parser provides a number of variables of the form
`%{HTTP_HOST}`. Note that the value of a variable may depend
on the phase of the request processing in which it is evaluated. For
example, an expression used in an `<If >`
directive is evaluated before authentication is done. Therefore,
`%{REMOTE_USER}` will not be set in this case.

For information on setting and manipulating request environment
variables (using `SetEnv`,
`SetEnvIf`,
`mod_rewrite`'s `[E=...]` flag, and
others), see [Environment Variables in Apache httpd](env.md).

The following variables provide the values of the named HTTP request
headers. The values of other headers can be obtained with the
`req` [function](#functions). Using these
variables may cause the header name to be added to the Vary
header of the HTTP response, except where otherwise noted for the
directive accepting the expression. The `req_novary`
[function](#functions) may be used to circumvent this
behavior.

[![top](./images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## Binary operators [¶](#binop "Permanent link")

With the exception of some built-in comparison operators, binary
operators have the form "`-[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]+`", i.e. a
minus and at least two characters. The name is not case sensitive.
Modules may register additional binary operators.

### Comparison operators

| Name | Alternative | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `==` | `=` | String equality |
| `!=` |  | String inequality |
| `<` |  | String less than |
| `<=` |  | String less than or equal |
| `>` |  | String greater than |
| `>=` |  | String greater than or equal |
| `=~` |  | String matches the regular expression |
| `!~` |  | String does not match the regular expression |
| `-eq` | `eq` | Integer equality |
| `-ne` | `ne` | Integer inequality |
| `-lt` | `lt` | Integer less than |
| `-le` | `le` | Integer less than or equal |
| `-gt` | `gt` | Integer greater than |
| `-ge` | `ge` | Integer greater than or equal |

### Other binary operators

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-ipmatch` | IP address matches address/netmask |
| `-strmatch` | left string matches pattern given by right string (containing wildcards \*, ?, []) |
| `-strcmatch` | same as `-strmatch`, but case insensitive |
| `-fnmatch` | same as `-strmatch`, but slashes are not matched by wildcards |

[![top](./images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## Unary operators [¶](#unnop "Permanent link")

Unary operators take one argument and have the form
"`-[a-zA-Z]`", i.e. a minus and one character.
The name *is* case sensitive.
Modules may register additional unary operators.

| Name | Description | Restricted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-d` | The argument is treated as a filename. True if the file exists and is a directory | yes |
| `-e` | The argument is treated as a filename. True if the file (or dir or special) exists | yes |
| `-f` | The argument is treated as a filename. True if the file exists and is regular file | yes |
| `-s` | The argument is treated as a filename. True if the file exists and is not empty | yes |
| `-L` | The argument is treated as a filename. True if the file exists and is symlink | yes |
| `-h` | The argument is treated as a filename. True if the file exists and is symlink (same as `-L`) | yes |
| `-F` | True if string is a valid file, accessible via all the server's currently-configured access controls for that path. This uses an internal subrequest to do the check, so use it with care - it can impact your server's performance! |  |
| `-U` | True if string is a valid URL, accessible via all the server's currently-configured access controls for that path. This uses an internal subrequest to do the check, so use it with care - it can impact your server's performance! |  |
| `-A` | Alias for `-U` |  |
| `-n` | True if string is not empty |  |
| `-z` | True if string is empty |  |
| `-T` | False if string is empty, "`0`", "`off`", "`false`", or "`no`" (case insensitive). True otherwise. |  |
| `-R` | Same as "`%{REMOTE_ADDR} -ipmatch ...`", but more efficient |  |

The operators marked as "restricted" are not available in some modules
like `mod_include`.

[![top](./images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## Functions [¶](#functions "Permanent link")

Normal string-valued functions take one string as argument and return
a string. Functions names are not case sensitive.
Modules may register additional functions.

| Name | Description | Special notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `req`, `http` | Get HTTP request header; header names may be added to the Vary header, see below |  |
| `req_novary` | Same as `req`, but header names will not be added to the Vary header |  |
| `resp` | Get HTTP response header (most response headers will not yet be set during `<If>`) |  |
| `reqenv` | Lookup request environment variable (as a shortcut, `v` can also be used to access variables). | ordering |
| `osenv` | Lookup operating system environment variable |  |
| `note` | Lookup request note | ordering |
| `env` | Return first match of `note`, `reqenv`, `osenv` | ordering |
| `tolower` | Convert string to lower case |  |
| `toupper` | Convert string to upper case |  |
| `escape` | Escape special characters in %hex encoding |  |
| `unescape` | Unescape %hex encoded string, leaving encoded slashes alone; return empty string if %00 is found |  |
| `base64` | Encode the string using base64 encoding |  |
| `unbase64` | Decode base64 encoded string, return truncated string if 0x00 is found |  |
| `md5` | Hash the string using MD5, then encode the hash with hexadecimal encoding |  |
| `sha1` | Hash the string using SHA1, then encode the hash with hexadecimal encoding |  |
| `file` | Read contents from a file (including line endings, when present) | restricted |
| `filesize` | Return size of a file (or 0 if file does not exist or is not regular file) | restricted |
| `ldap` | Escape characters as required by LDAP distinguished name escaping (RFC4514) and LDAP filter escaping (RFC4515).  (Available in httpd 2.4.53 and later) |  |

The functions marked as "restricted" in the final column are not
available in some modules like `mod_include`.

The functions marked as "ordering" in the final column require some
consideration for the ordering of different components of the server,
especially when the function is used within the
<`If`> directive which is
evaluated relatively early.

### Environment variable ordering

When environment variables are looked up within an
<`If`> condition, it's important
to consider how extremely early in request processing that this
resolution occurs. As a guideline, any directive defined outside of virtual host
context (directory, location, htaccess) is not likely to have yet had a
chance to execute. `SetEnvIf`
in virtual host scope is one directive that runs prior to this resolution
  
  
When `reqenv` is used outside of <`If`>, the resolution will generally occur later, but the
exact timing depends on the directive the expression has been used within.

The `reqenv` function can be used to test
[special-purpose environment variables](env.md#special)
(such as `no-gzip`, `nokeepalive`, etc.) as
well as any variables set via [SetEnv,
SetEnvIf, or mod\_rewrite](env.md#setting).

When the functions `req` or `http` are used,
the header name will automatically be added to the Vary header of the
HTTP response, except where otherwise noted for the directive accepting
the expression. The `req_novary` function can be used to
prevent names from being added to the Vary header.

In addition to string-valued functions, there are also
list-valued functions which take one string as argument and return a
wordlist, i.e. a list of strings. The wordlist can be used with the
special `-in` operator. Functions names are not case
sensitive. Modules may register additional functions.

There are no built-in list-valued functions. `mod_ssl`
provides `PeerExtList`. See the description of
`SSLRequire` for details
(but `PeerExtList` is also usable outside
of `SSLRequire`).

## Example expressions [¶](#examples "Permanent link")

The following examples show how expressions might be used to
evaluate requests:

```
# Compare the host name to example.com and redirect to www.example.com if it matches
<If "%{HTTP_HOST} == 'example.com'">
    Redirect permanent "/" "http://www.example.com/"
</If>

# Force text/plain if requesting a file with the query string contains 'forcetext'
<If "%{QUERY_STRING} =~ /forcetext/">
    ForceType text/plain
</If>

# Only allow access to this content during business hours
<Directory "/foo/bar/business">
    Require expr %{TIME_HOUR} -gt 9 && %{TIME_HOUR} -lt 17
</Directory>

# Check a HTTP header for a list of values
<If "%{HTTP:X-example-header} in { 'foo', 'bar', 'baz' }">
    Header set matched true
</If>

# Check an environment variable for a regular expression, negated.
<If "! reqenv('REDIRECT_FOO') =~ /bar/">
    Header set matched true
</If>

# Check result of URI mapping by running in Directory context with -f
<Directory "/var/www">
    AddEncoding x-gzip gz
<If "-f '%{REQUEST_FILENAME}.unzipme' && ! %{HTTP:Accept-Encoding} =~ /gzip/">
      SetOutputFilter INFLATE
</If>
</Directory>

# Check against the client IP
<If "-R '192.168.1.0/24'">
    Header set matched true
</If>

# Function example in boolean context
<If "md5('foo') == 'acbd18db4cc2f85cedef654fccc4a4d8'">
  Header set checksum-matched true
</If>

# Function example in string context
Header set foo-checksum "expr=%{md5:foo}"

# This delays the evaluation of the condition clause compared to <If>
Header always set CustomHeader my-value "expr=%{REQUEST_URI} =~ m#^/special_path\.php$#"

# Conditional logging
CustomLog logs/access-errors.log common "expr=%{REQUEST_STATUS} >= 400"
CustomLog logs/access-errors-specific.log common "expr=%{REQUEST_STATUS} -in {'405','410'}"
```

[![top](./images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## Other [¶](#other "Permanent link")

| Name | Alternative | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-in` | `in` | string contained in wordlist |
| `/regexp/` | `m#regexp#` | Regular expression (the second form allows different delimiters than /) |
| `/regexp/i` | `m#regexp#i` | Case insensitive regular expression |
| `$0 ... $9` |  | Regular expression backreferences |

### Regular expression backreferences

The strings `$0` ... `$9` allow to reference
the capture groups from a previously executed, successfully
matching regular expressions. They can normally only be used in the
same expression as the matching regex, but some modules allow special
uses.

[![top](./images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## Comparison with SSLRequire [¶](#sslrequire "Permanent link")

The *ap\_expr* syntax is mostly a superset of the syntax of the
deprecated `SSLRequire` directive.
The differences are described in `SSLRequire`'s documentation.

[![top](./images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## Version History [¶](#compatibility "Permanent link")

The `req_novary` [function](#functions)
is available for versions 2.4.4 and later.
