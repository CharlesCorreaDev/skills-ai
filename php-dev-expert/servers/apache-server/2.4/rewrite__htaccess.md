# Per-directory Rewrites

Using `mod_rewrite` in `.htaccess` files
is one of the most common - and most confusing -
[per-directory](glossary.md#perdirectory "see glossary") configurations.
This document explains the key differences between using rewrite
rules in server configuration versus `.htaccess` files,
and provides practical guidance for avoiding the most common pitfalls.

For the low-level technical details of how `mod_rewrite`
processes rules in per-directory context, see the
[Technical Details](rewrite__tech.md#InternalAPI) document.

## Prerequisites: AllowOverride [¶](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

Before `mod_rewrite` directives in a
`.htaccess` file will be processed at all, the server
configuration must permit them. This requires:

```
<Directory "/var/www/htdocs">
    AllowOverride FileInfo
</Directory>
```

Without at least `AllowOverride FileInfo` (or
`AllowOverride All`), any `mod_rewrite`
directives in `.htaccess` files are silently ignored.
If your rules don't appear to be doing anything, this is the first
thing to check.

Additionally, either `Options FollowSymLinks` or
`Options SymLinksIfOwnerMatch` must be enabled for the
directory in question. Because a
`RewriteRule` can map a URL
to an arbitrary filesystem path - functionally equivalent to a symbolic
link - `mod_rewrite` refuses to operate in per-directory
context unless one of these options is set. Without it, you will see
the following error:

`AH00670: Options FollowSymLinks and SymLinksIfOwnerMatch are both off,
so the RewriteRule directive is also forbidden due to its similar
ability to circumvent directory restrictions`

This restriction applies to both `.htaccess` files and
`<Directory>` blocks.

## What URL does the rule see? [¶](#path-stripping "Permanent link")

In server or virtualhost context, the
`RewriteRule` pattern is
matched against the full URL-path, starting with a leading slash.
In `.htaccess` context, the directory prefix is
**stripped**.

For example, if your `.htaccess` is in
`/var/www/htdocs/app/` and a request comes in for
`/app/products/widget`, the RewriteRule sees only
`products/widget` - no leading slash, no
`/app/` prefix.

![Flowchart showing the path stripping, substitution,           and RewriteBase pipeline in per-directory context, with           three outcomes: relative path (RewriteBase prepended),           absolute path (used as-is), and absolute URI (external           redirect)](../images/rewrite_path_stripping.png)  
Figure: Per-directory path stripping and RewriteBase pipeline

This means you must write your patterns differently depending on
where the rule lives:

| Location of rule | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| VirtualHost section | `RewriteRule "^/app/products/(.+)$" "/app/shop.php?item=$1"` |
| .htaccess in /var/www/htdocs/app/ | `RewriteRule "^products/(.+)$" "shop.php?item=$1"` |

Note that the `.htaccess` version has no leading slash
in either the pattern or the substitution. This is the single most
common source of confusion with per-directory rewriting.

When a substitution is made in per-directory context, Apache issues
a new internal subrequest with the rewritten URL, restarting request
processing from the top. If the substitution is a relative path,
the `RewriteBase` directive
determines what URL-path prefix is prepended. This subrequest
mechanism is also why rules can loop — see
[below](#loops).

### Do not start .htaccess patterns with /

Because the directory prefix (including the trailing
slash) is stripped before matching, patterns in
[per-directory context](glossary.md#perdirectory "see glossary")
will *never* match a leading slash. A pattern
beginning with `^/` will never match in this
context. A rule like `RewriteRule "^/foo" ...` will
silently fail to match anything when placed in a
`.htaccess` file.

If you need to match against the full original
URL-path (including the directory prefix), use
`%{REQUEST_URI}` in a
`RewriteCond`:

```
RewriteCond "%{REQUEST_URI}" "^/admin/"
RewriteRule "^.*$" "-" [F]
```

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## When you need RewriteBase [¶](#rewritebase "Permanent link")

When `mod_rewrite` makes a substitution in
`.htaccess` context, it needs to turn the relative result
back into a full URL-path. The
`RewriteBase` directive tells
it what prefix to prepend.

By default, `RewriteBase`
is set to the physical directory path of the `.htaccess`
file. In most cases, this does the right thing, and you don't need
to set it explicitly. But there are situations where you do:

- **Alias or symlink:** If the directory is reached via
  an `Alias` or a symlink, the
  URL path and the filesystem path differ, and
  `RewriteBase` must be set
  to the URL path.
- **Subdirectory applications:** A common pattern for
  PHP frameworks is to place a `.htaccess` in a subdirectory
  (say, `/var/www/htdocs/myapp/`) and route all requests to
  a front controller:

```
# In /var/www/htdocs/myapp/.htaccess
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase "/myapp/"
RewriteCond "%{REQUEST_FILENAME}" !-f
RewriteCond "%{REQUEST_FILENAME}" !-d
RewriteRule "^(.*)$" "index.php" [L]
```

For this particular use case - routing all unmatched
requests to a front controller - the
[FallbackResource](rewrite__avoid.md#fallback-resource) directive
is a simpler and more efficient alternative to mod\_rewrite.

Without the `RewriteBase "/myapp/"` line, the rewritten
URL might resolve incorrectly, because `mod_rewrite`
would prepend the filesystem path rather than the URL path.

If you're using absolute URLs (starting with `/` or
`http://`) in your substitutions,
`RewriteBase` has no effect
- it only applies to relative substitutions.

## The [L] flag and looping [¶](#loops "Permanent link")

In server context, the `[L]` flag means "stop processing
the ruleset." In `.htaccess` context, it means something
subtly different: "stop processing the ruleset *for this pass*."
After the substitution is made, Apache re-processes the request from
the top - including re-applying the `.htaccess` rules.
This can lead to infinite loops.

![Flowchart showing how the [L] flag causes looping in           per-directory context by triggering a subrequest that           re-enters the ruleset](../images/rewrite_l_flag_looping.png)  
Figure: Per-directory [L] flag looping behavior

Consider this rule:

```
# In .htaccess - this may loop!
RewriteRule "^(.*)$" "/index.php?q=$1" [L]
```

On the first pass, a request for `/hello` is rewritten to
`/index.php?q=hello`. Then the request is re-processed, and
now `index.php` matches `^(.*)$` again, rewriting
to `/index.php?q=index.php`. This continues until Apache
hits its internal redirect limit and returns a 500 error. You will see
the following in the error log:

`AH00124: Request exceeded the limit of 10 internal redirects due to
probable configuration error. Use 'LimitInternalRecursion' to increase
the limit if necessary. Use 'LogLevel debug' to get a backtrace.`

There are several ways to break the loop:

**Option 1: Use the [END] flag** (recommended)

```
RewriteRule "^(.*)$" "/index.php?q=$1" [END]
```

The `[END]` flag (available since Apache 2.3.9) stops
*all* further rewrite processing, including subsequent passes.
It is the cleanest way to prevent loops.

**Option 2: Add a condition to skip already-rewritten URLs**

```
RewriteCond "%{REQUEST_FILENAME}" !-f
RewriteCond "%{REQUEST_FILENAME}" !-d
RewriteRule "^(.*)$" "/index.php?q=$1" [L]
```

Since `index.php` exists as a file, the
`!-f` condition causes the rule to be skipped on the second
pass.

**Option 3: Check THE\_REQUEST**

```
RewriteCond "%{THE_REQUEST}" "!index\.php"
RewriteRule "^(.*)$" "/index.php?q=$1" [L]
```

The `%{THE_REQUEST}` variable contains the original
request line as sent by the client, which is not modified by
`mod_rewrite`. Checking it prevents the rule from
matching rewritten URLs.

## RewriteMap cannot be declared in .htaccess [¶](#rewritemap-restriction "Permanent link")

The `RewriteMap` directive
can only be declared in server or virtualhost context - not in
`.htaccess` files or
`<Directory>` blocks.
However, once a map is declared in the server configuration, you
*can* use it from a `.htaccess` file:

```
# In httpd.conf or a VirtualHost
RewriteMap product2id "txt:/etc/apache2/productmap.txt"
```

```
# In .htaccess - using the map declared above
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule "^product/(.+)$" "/prods.php?id=${product2id:$1|NOTFOUND}" [PT]
```

This restriction exists because `.htaccess` files are
parsed on every request, and map initialization (especially for
`dbm:`, `dbd:`, and `prg:` map types)
would be prohibitively expensive to repeat each time.

## Which contexts support rewrite rules? [¶](#context-restrictions "Permanent link")

Rewrite rules are supported in
[per-directory context](glossary.md#perdirectory "see glossary")
([.htaccess](howto__htaccess.md) files,
`<Directory>`, and
`<If>` blocks).

Although rewrite rules are syntactically permitted in
`<Location>`
and `<Files>`
sections (including their regex counterparts), this is
unsupported and should never be necessary. Relative
substitutions, in particular, are likely to break in
these contexts.

### These containers silently change rewrite behavior

Placing a `RewriteRule`
inside a `<Directory>`,
`<If>`, or
`<Location>` block
— even inside a
`<VirtualHost>` in the
main server config — silently switches to
[per-directory context](glossary.md#perdirectory "see glossary") behavior.
This means the leading slash is stripped from the URL before pattern
matching, substitutions trigger an internal redirect (with loop risk),
and the [[L]](rewrite__flags.md#flag_l) flag no longer
truly stops processing — use
[[END]](rewrite__flags.md#flag_end) instead.

## Rule inheritance with RewriteOptions [¶](#inheritance "Permanent link")

By default, `mod_rewrite` rules are **not
inherited** by subdirectories. If you define rules in
`/var/www/htdocs/.htaccess`, they apply to that directory
only. A `.htaccess` file in a subdirectory starts with
an empty ruleset, unless you explicitly enable inheritance.

The `RewriteOptions`
directive controls this behavior:

`RewriteOptions Inherit`
:   Rules from the parent context are appended to the current ruleset.
    The child's rules are processed first, then the parent's. Use this
    when a subdirectory needs to add its own rules while keeping the
    parent's rules active.

`RewriteOptions InheritBefore`
:   Like `Inherit`, but the parent's rules are processed
    *before* the child's. This is useful when the parent defines
    a front-controller pattern and the child needs to add exceptions.
    Available since Apache 2.4.8.

`RewriteOptions InheritDown`
:   Set this in the parent context to force all child contexts to
    inherit the parent's rules, without requiring each child to specify
    `Inherit`. Available since Apache 2.4.8.

`RewriteOptions InheritDownBefore`
:   Like `InheritDown`, but forces the parent's rules to
    run before the child's. Available since Apache 2.4.8.

`RewriteOptions IgnoreInherit`
:   Set this in a child context to opt out of inheritance that was
    forced by a parent's `InheritDown`.
    Available since Apache 2.4.8.

`RewriteOptions MergeBase`
:   When inheritance is enabled, the `RewriteBase` from
    each context is used for rules defined in that context, rather than
    applying the child's `RewriteBase` to all inherited rules.
    Available since Apache 2.4.26.

## Debugging .htaccess rewrite rules [¶](#debugging "Permanent link")

When `.htaccess` rules are not doing what you expect,
the rewrite log is your most important tool. Enable it at the
appropriate trace level:

```
LogLevel alert rewrite:trace3
```

This produces detailed output in the error log showing exactly
how each rule is processed - what pattern was matched against,
whether conditions succeeded or failed, and what substitution was
made. The per-directory context and path stripping behavior will be
visible in these log entries.

Do not leave trace-level logging enabled in
production. It generates a large volume of output and will affect
performance.

## Browser caching of 301 redirects [¶](#caching "Permanent link")

When you issue a `301 Moved Permanently` redirect
(via `[R=301]` or `Redirect permanent`), the browser is allowed to cache
that response indefinitely. This means that even after you fix an
incorrect redirect rule in your configuration, returning visitors
may continue to be sent to the old (wrong) destination without
ever contacting your server again.

While debugging redirect rules, use `[R=302]`
(temporary redirect) instead of `[R=301]`. Switch to 301
only after you have confirmed the rule is correct. If you have
already issued an incorrect 301, affected users will need to clear
their browser cache (or use a private/incognito window) to see
the corrected behavior.

Search engines also cache 301 redirects. An incorrect 301
may take days or weeks to be re-crawled, even after the
configuration is fixed. This is another reason to test with 302
first.
