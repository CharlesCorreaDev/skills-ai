# Guide to Apache mod\_rewrite

*The great thing about mod\_rewrite is it gives you all the
configurability and flexibility of Sendmail. The downside to
mod\_rewrite is that it gives you all the configurability and
flexibility of Sendmail.*
-- Brian Behlendorf

*Despite the tons of examples and docs, mod\_rewrite is voodoo.
Damned cool voodoo, but still voodoo.*
-- Brian Moore

`mod_rewrite` provides a way to modify incoming
URL requests, dynamically, based on [regular
expression](rewrite__intro.md#regex) rules. This allows you to map arbitrary URLs onto
your internal URL structure in any way you like.

This guide supplements [the
reference manual](mod__mod_rewrite.md) with annotated examples, conceptual
explanations, and practical advice. It is organized as follows:

[Introduction](rewrite__intro.md)
:   Core concepts: regular expression syntax, RewriteRule and
    RewriteCond basics, and how mod\_rewrite fits into the request
    processing lifecycle.

[Per-directory Rewrites](rewrite__htaccess.md)
:   The key differences between using rewrite rules in server
    configuration versus [per-directory](glossary.md#perdirectory "see glossary")
    context, including path stripping, RewriteBase, and the looping behavior
    of the [L] flag.

[RewriteRule Flags](rewrite__flags.md)
:   A complete reference for all flags that can modify the behavior of
    a RewriteRule, with examples for each.

[Using RewriteMap](rewrite__rewritemap.md)
:   How to use external lookup sources — text files, DBM databases,
    SQL queries, and internal functions — to drive your rewrite
    rules.

[Redirection and Remapping](rewrite__remapping.md)
:   Recipes for common tasks: HTTPS redirection, canonical hostnames,
    trailing slash normalization, front-controller routing, and more.

[Dynamic Virtual Hosts](rewrite__vhosts.md)
:   Using mod\_rewrite to dynamically map hostnames to document roots
    without individual VirtualHost blocks.

[When NOT to use mod\_rewrite](rewrite__avoid.md)
:   Many common tasks are better accomplished with simpler directives.
    This document shows the alternatives and when to prefer them.

[Technical Details](rewrite__tech.md)
:   How mod\_rewrite hooks into the Apache request processing phases,
    and the order in which rules and conditions are evaluated.
