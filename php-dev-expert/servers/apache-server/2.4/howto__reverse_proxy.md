# Reverse Proxy Guide

Besides serving static and dynamic content directly, Apache httpd
can act as a reverse proxy server (sometimes called a gateway).

In this mode, httpd does not generate the content itself. Instead,
it forwards each client request to one or more backend servers that
have no direct connection to the external network. The backend
processes the request and returns the content to httpd, which then
delivers the HTTP response to the client.

Common reasons include security, high availability, load balancing,
and centralized authentication. The backend infrastructure should be isolated from the external
network; as far as the client is concerned, the reverse proxy
*is* the sole source of all content.

A typical implementation is below:

## Simple reverse proxying [¶](#simple "Permanent link")

The `ProxyPass`
directive specifies the mapping of incoming requests to the backend
server (or a cluster of servers known as a `Balancer`
group). The simplest example proxies all requests (`"/"`)
to a single backend:

```
ProxyPass "/"  "http://www.example.com/"
```

To ensure that `Location:` headers generated from
the backend are modified to point to the reverse proxy, instead of
back to itself, the `ProxyPassReverse`
directive is most often required:

```
ProxyPass "/"  "http://www.example.com/"
ProxyPassReverse "/"  "http://www.example.com/"
```

Only specific URIs can be proxied, as shown in this example:

```
ProxyPass "/images"  "http://www.example.com/"
ProxyPassReverse "/images"  "http://www.example.com/"
```

In the above, any requests which start with the `/images`
path will be proxied to the specified backend, otherwise it will be handled
locally.

## Clusters and Balancers [¶](#cluster "Permanent link")

The single-backend setup above has an obvious weakness: if that
node goes down or becomes overloaded, the proxied content is unavailable.
What you need is a group of backend servers that the reverse proxy can
load-balance and failover among. This group is sometimes called a *cluster*; Apache httpd's
term is a *balancer*. You define a balancer using the
`<Proxy>` and
`BalancerMember` directives:

```
<Proxy balancer://myset>
BalancerMember http://www2.example.com:8080
BalancerMember http://www3.example.com:8080
ProxySet lbmethod=bytraffic
</Proxy>

ProxyPass "/images/"  "balancer://myset/"
ProxyPassReverse "/images/"  "balancer://myset/"
```

The `balancer://` scheme is what tells httpd that we are creating
a balancer set, with the name *myset*. It includes 2 backend servers,
which httpd calls *BalancerMembers*. In this case, any requests for
`/images` will be proxied to *one* of the 2 backends.
The `ProxySet` directive
specifies that the *myset* Balancer use a load balancing algorithm
that balances based on I/O bytes.

### Hint

*BalancerMembers* are also sometimes referred to as *workers*.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## Balancer and BalancerMember configuration [¶](#config "Permanent link")

You can tune *balancers* and *workers* through
parameters on `ProxyPass`.
For example, to have `http://www3.example.com:8080`
handle 3× the traffic with a 1-second timeout:

```
<Proxy balancer://myset>
BalancerMember http://www2.example.com:8080
BalancerMember http://www3.example.com:8080 loadfactor=3 timeout=1
ProxySet lbmethod=bytraffic
</Proxy>

ProxyPass "/images"  "balancer://myset/"
ProxyPassReverse "/images"  "balancer://myset/"
```

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## Failover [¶](#failover "Permanent link")

You can fine-tune failover scenarios, specifying which workers and
balancers handle traffic when others fail. The setup below
implements three failover cases:

1. `http://spare1.example.com:8080` and
   `http://spare2.example.com:8080` are only sent traffic if one
   or both of `http://www2.example.com:8080` or
   `http://www3.example.com:8080` is unavailable. (One spare
   will be used to replace one unusable member of the same balancer set.)
2. `http://hstandby.example.com:8080` is only sent traffic if
   all other workers in balancer set `0` are not available.
3. If all load balancer set `0` workers, spares, and the standby
   are unavailable, only then will the
   `http://bkup1.example.com:8080` and
   `http://bkup2.example.com:8080` workers from balancer set
   `1` be brought into rotation.

You can have one or more hot spares and hot standbys for each
load balancer set.

```
<Proxy balancer://myset>
BalancerMember http://www2.example.com:8080
BalancerMember http://www3.example.com:8080 loadfactor=3 timeout=1
BalancerMember http://spare1.example.com:8080 status=+R
BalancerMember http://spare2.example.com:8080 status=+R
BalancerMember http://hstandby.example.com:8080 status=+H
BalancerMember http://bkup1.example.com:8080 lbset=1
BalancerMember http://bkup2.example.com:8080 lbset=1
ProxySet lbmethod=byrequests
</Proxy>

ProxyPass "/images/"  "balancer://myset/"
ProxyPassReverse "/images/"  "balancer://myset/"
```

Hot spares replace unusable workers (draining, stopped, or in an
error state) within the same load balancer set. Hot standbys
activate only when all workers and spares in a set are unavailable.
Sets are tried in order from lowest to highest.

## Balancer Manager [¶](#manager "Permanent link")

Apache httpd includes an embedded *balancer-manager*
application. Like `mod_status`, it displays the
current configuration and status of your balancers and workers.
It also lets you reconfigure them at runtime—including adding
new *BalancerMembers* to an existing balancer. To enable
it, add the following to your configuration:

```
<Location "/balancer-manager">
SetHandler balancer-manager
Require host localhost
</Location>
```

### Warning

Do not enable the *balancer-manager* until you have [secured your server](mod__mod_proxy.md#access). In
particular, ensure that access to the URL is tightly
restricted.

When you access that URL
(e.g. `http://rproxy.example.com/balancer-manager/`), you
will see a page like this:

![balancer-manager page](../images/bal-man.png)

From here you can adjust parameters, take workers offline, change
load balancing methods, and add new workers. Clicking on the
balancer itself shows:

![balancer-manager page](../images/bal-man-b.png)

Whereas clicking on a worker, displays this page:

![balancer-manager page](../images/bal-man-w.png)

To persist these changes across restarts, enable
`BalancerPersist`.

## Dynamic Health Checks [¶](#health-check "Permanent link")

Before proxying a request, httpd can test whether a worker is
available using the `ping` parameter in
`ProxyPass`. Often it is
more useful to check worker health *out of band*.
`mod_proxy_hcheck` provides this capability.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)

## BalancerMember status flags [¶](#status "Permanent link")

In the *balancer-manager* the current state, or *status*, of a worker
is displayed and can be set/reset. The meanings of these statuses are as follows:

| Flag | String | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | *Ok* | Worker is available |
|  | *Init* | Worker has been initialized |
| `D` | *Dis* | Worker is disabled and will not accept any requests; will be automatically retried. |
| `S` | *Stop* | Worker is administratively stopped; will not accept requests and will not be automatically retried |
| `I` | *Ign* | Worker is in ignore-errors mode and will always be considered available. |
| `R` | *Spar* | Worker is a hot spare. For each worker in a given lbset that is unusable (draining, stopped, in error, etc.), a usable hot spare with the same lbset will be used in its place. Hot spares can help ensure that a specific number of workers are always available for use by a balancer. |
| `H` | *Stby* | Worker is in hot-standby mode and will only be used if no other viable workers or spares are available in the balancer set. |
| `E` | *Err* | Worker is in an error state, usually due to failing pre-request check; requests will not be proxied to this worker, but it will be retried depending on the `retry` setting of the worker. |
| `N` | *Drn* | Worker is in drain mode and will only accept existing sticky sessions destined for itself and ignore all other requests. |
| `C` | *HcFl* | Worker has failed dynamic health check and will not be used until it passes subsequent health checks. |
