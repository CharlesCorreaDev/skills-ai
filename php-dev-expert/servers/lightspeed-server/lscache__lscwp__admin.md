## Suppressing non-critical banners[¶](#suppressing-non-critical-banners "Permanent link")

Sometimes the LiteSpeed Cache plugin for WordPress adds informational banners to your WordPress dashboard, such as this one:

[![Informational banner in the WordPress dashboard](../images/admin-lscwp-banner.png)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/images/admin-lscwp-banner.png)

These banners are meant to be informational, but they are not critical to the functioning of the plugin. As of LSCWP v3.0, these banners are opt-in only, meaning that by default, they are not displayed. If you would like to opt in to seeing LiteSpeed news (hotfixes, new releases, available beta versions, promotions, and other updates) on your dashboard, navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache > General > General Settings** and set **Notifications** to `ON`.

Note

This setting does not suppress notifications such as `Purged all caches successfully.` and other messages related to the functioning of the plugin.

## Admin IP commands[¶](#admin-ip-commands "Permanent link")

The LSCWP\_CTRL Admin IP commands give you access to certain actions from the browser window by way of a simple query string.

To trigger one of these actions for a page, access the page with the `?LSCWP_CTRL=ACTION` query string appended to the end of the URL.

Example

To purge the `https://example.com/2023/todays-blog-post/` blog post, visit this URL: `https://example.com/2023/todays-blog-post/?LSCWP_CTRL=PURGE`.

The `PURGE` action, and most others, are restricted by IP address. You can give trusted users and admins access to all the actions by adding their IP addresses in **Toolbox > Debug Settings > Admin IPs**. You do not need to be logged in to use these actions.

| Action | Used for | Admin IP required |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `NOCACHE` | Display a page without caching it. An example use case is to compare a cached version of a page with an uncached version. | Yes |  |
| `before_optm` | View the page without any of the optimizations enabled. | No |  |
| `SHOWHEADERS` | Display all of the cache headers associated with a page in the Inspect tool. | Yes | This may be useful for debugging purposes, as certain cache headers are normally not shown. |
| `PURGE` | Purge all cache tags associated with the page, except the blog ID tag. Pages with the same cache tag will be purged as well. | Yes |  |
| `PURGESINGLE` | Purge only the URL cache tag associated with the page. | Yes |  |

Note

Actions are case-sensitive.

## WordPress CLI[¶](#wordpress-cli "Permanent link")

This documentation has moved to its own page. Please see [WordPress CLI](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lsws/lscache/lscwp/cli/).

## Using a default configuration[¶](#using-a-default-configuration "Permanent link")

The `const.default.ini` file contains the default configuration for LSCWP. It can be used, for example, by hosting providers to change the default settings for the plugin. The file is located in `/wp-content/litespeed-cache/data`.

As of v3.3 of our [WHM plugin](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lsws/cp/cpanel/wp-cache-management/), hosting providers can use a custom `const.default.ini` file when enabling or mass-enabling LSCWP by placing the file in `/usr/src/litespeed-wp-plugin`. This file will then be used for all sites installing a new copy of LSCWP.

Changes to `const.default.ini` do not prevent users from changing their plugin settings.

## Using multiple optimization plugins[¶](#using-multiple-optimization-plugins "Permanent link")

LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress has many optimization features in addition to our signature full-page cache, and as such, you probably do not need any other similar plugins. If you still want to use one of the other WordPress optimization plugins for whatever reason, that should not be a problem, as long as you do not use the same features in both.

For example, if you are using our full-page cache and our CDN support, make sure that page cache and CDN support are disabled in any other plugin you use. Similarly, if you are using a minification function in another plugin, keep minification disabled in our plugin.

Duplicating functionality bogs down your server at best and breaks your site at worst. So do not do it!

[To learn more about this, see our blog.](https://blog.litespeedtech.com/2017/08/02/wpw-using-multiple-cache-plugins/)

### Compatibility check[¶](#compatibility-check "Permanent link")

Not all cache plugins are good candidates to pair with LiteSpeed. To avoid duplicating our functions, a plugin must either:

1. Not include the same cache and optimization functions as LiteSpeed Cache; or
2. Include cache and optimization functions that can be disabled one by one.

### Set up another plugin[¶](#set-up-another-plugin "Permanent link")

Before you install and activate LiteSpeed Cache, you should first get the other plugin working to your satisfaction. Doing this first will make it easier to follow the plugin’s instructions without worrying about how it will affect LiteSpeed’s setup.

Once the plugin is installed, activated, and set up to your liking, *purge that plugin’s cache* to ensure there are no conflicts from the start. Then *disable the cache and all of the duplicate optimization functions that you plan to use in LSCWP*.

### Set up LSCWP[¶](#set-up-lscwp "Permanent link")

[Install and activate LSCWP](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lsws/lscache/lscwp/installation/). Enable the cache and any optimization features you wish to use in LSCWP.

### Verify[¶](#verify "Permanent link")

At this point, you should have both plugins working together in harmony, but you’ll want to do a quick test, just to be sure. To verify that your pages are actually being cached by LiteSpeed, you can [follow these steps](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lsws/lscache/lscwp/installation/#verify-your-site-is-being-cached).

If the page was not cached by LiteSpeed, then something in your setup is not quite right. [Contact us](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/litespeed-cache) if you need help!

If the page *was* cached by LiteSpeed, then the setup is finished. Don’t forget to take a look at your LiteSpeed Cache settings and see if anything needs adjustment. In general, the default settings are fine, but you might want to tweak a few things since you’ve got the other plugin running, too.

## Translate LSCache for WordPress[¶](#translate-lscache-for-wordpress "Permanent link")

LSCWP is written in U.S. English, so we rely on our international users to help us translate the plugin for worldwide use. If you are fluent in a language other than U.S. English and have a few minutes to contribute to our plugin, we would appreciate it!

### Is your language needed?[¶](#is-your-language-needed "Permanent link")

[![Translation project language list](../images/admin-lscwp-translate1.png)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/images/admin-lscwp-translate1.png)

We have a few languages very well covered, so you’ll want to check the [Translating WordPress page for LiteSpeed Cache](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/litespeed-cache) and look for your language (and geographic location, if applicable). If there are red or yellow boxes next to the language, then your expertise is needed.

As you can see, we have quite a few red boxes as of this writing, as well as several more pages of them beyond where the screenshot ends. The most important column is the **Stable** column. Languages with shades of red in the **Stable** column have less than a third of the plugin translated.

### Submit a translation[¶](#submit-a-translation "Permanent link")

All you need is a WordPress.org login. Once you are logged in, you can [click the link](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/litespeed-cache) and start translating at your own pace.

The instructions are the same for whichever language and geographic location you choose, but for simplicity’s sake, let’s say you’re from Spain and would like to contribute to the Spanish (Spain) translation.

Click **Spanish (Spain)** to be brought to the es\_ES translation page.

[![Spanish (Spain) translation page](../images/admin-lscwp-translate2.png)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/images/admin-lscwp-translate2.png)

The most important section to work on first is **Stable (latest release)**, so click on it to see which strings are still missing translations.

[![Stable translation strings](../images/admin-lscwp-translate3.png)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/images/admin-lscwp-translate3.png)

You’ll be brought to a list of strings and their current translations, if any.

This list may look overwhelming if it is not well populated. However, *you are not required to translate every single string*. You could spend half an hour and do thirty of them, ten of them, or even just one. Every contribution, even a small one, gets us closer to a complete translation.

When you see a string you’d like to translate (for example, `Communicated with Cloudflare successfully`), double-click the **Translation** column for that string and enter your translation in the box.

[![Translation field for a string](../images/admin-lscwp-translate4.png)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/images/admin-lscwp-translate4.png)

Click the **Suggest new translation** button. Congratulations, you have successfully translated your first string.

### Approval[¶](#approval "Permanent link")

All translations must be approved by an editor for your language before they are incorporated into the plugin.

If you would like to be a translation editor for LSCache, just keep translating! We will notice you and apply to WordPress.org to give you editor access. Additionally, we’ll add you to our Slack team, where you can communicate with our other editors and be kept in the loop about new plugin updates and needed translations.

Thank you for helping us make LSCWP accessible for a global audience!

## Enabling and limiting the crawler[¶](#enabling-and-limiting-the-crawler "Permanent link")

These instructions apply to the WordPress LSCache crawler and other CMS LSCache crawlers where available.

Because the crawler can consume considerable resources, server administrators control whether it is enabled. In [a control panel environment](#shared-hosting-control-panel-environment), such as cPanel, the crawler is *disabled* by default and can only be enabled by an admin through Apache configuration. In the [LSWS Native environment](#litespeed-native), the crawler is *enabled* by default and can be disabled at the server or virtual host level in LSWS v5.3.5 and above.

Warning

We do not recommend enabling the crawler for shared hosting setups unless the server has enough capacity to handle it!

### Shared hosting / control panel environment[¶](#shared-hosting-control-panel-environment "Permanent link")

As of LSWS v5.1.16, there are four different approaches you can take to crawling on your server:

- You can disable it for the entire server.
- You can disable it for the entire server and selectively enable it for specific virtual hosts.
- You can enable it for the entire server.
- You can enable it for the entire server and selectively disable it for specific virtual hosts.

#### Enabling the crawler[¶](#enabling-the-crawler "Permanent link")

To enable the crawler in either of the second two scenarios, add this “Crawler Snippet” to the appropriate configuration or include file:

```
<IfModule Litespeed>
    CacheEngine on crawler
</IfModule>
```

The exact location of the relevant configuration or include file varies depending on the control panel you use (if any) and which of the options above you want to enact. See below for instructions relevant to your setup.

Tip

This snippet should not be added to `.htaccess`. It must be added to an Apache configuration file.

After you’ve added the Crawler Snippet in the appropriate location, you should gracefully restart the server.

#### Limiting the crawler[¶](#limiting-the-crawler "Permanent link")

Currently, the following variables are available for use with [the Crawler function](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lsws/lscache/lscwp/crawler/):

- `CRAWLER_USLEEP` sets a minimum allowed value for the **Delay** field.
- `CRAWLER_LOAD_LIMIT` sets a default value for the **Server Load Limit** field.
- `CRAWLER_LOAD_LIMIT_ENFORCE` sets a maximum allowed value for the **Server Load Limit** field.

To use these variables, add them one per line to the appropriate configuration file. For example:

```
<IfModule LiteSpeed>
    CacheEngine on crawler
    SetEnv CRAWLER_USLEEP 1000
    SetEnv CRAWLER_LOAD_LIMIT 5.2
</IfModule>
```

#### Disabling the crawler[¶](#disabling-the-crawler "Permanent link")

You may disable the crawler for an Apache virtual host in any situation. Add `CacheEngine -crawler` to the Apache virtual host configuration, like this:

```
<IfModule LiteSpeed>
    CacheEngine -crawler
</IfModule>
```

#### cPanel/WHM[¶](#cpanelwhm "Permanent link")

##### Server level[¶](#server-level "Permanent link")

Change your working directory to:

- `/usr/local/apache/conf/includes/` for EA3
- `/etc/apache2/conf.d/includes/` for EA4

Add the Crawler Snippet and optional server variables to the `pre_main_global.conf` file.

##### Global virtual host level[¶](#global-virtual-host-level "Permanent link")

Change your working directory to:

- `/usr/local/apache/conf/userdata/` for EA3
- `/etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/` for EA4

If these directories do not exist, create them.

Add the Crawler Snippet and optional server variables to the `lscache_vhosts.conf` file.

Apply these changes to all virtual hosts by running the following command:

```
/scripts/ensure_vhost_includes --all-users
```

Note

You only need to run this command once. It activates the configuration for all users, including new users created by WHM. There is no need to edit the cPanel skeleton file.

##### Individual virtual host level[¶](#individual-virtual-host-level "Permanent link")

Change your working directory to:

- For EA3: `/usr/local/apache/conf/userdata/std/2_4/<user>/<domain>/`
- For EA4: `/etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/std/2_4/<user>/<domain>/`

If your site supports HTTPS (SSL), also change to the appropriate working directory:

- For EA3: `/usr/local/apache/conf/userdata/ssl/2_4/<user>/<domain>/`
- For EA4: `/etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/ssl/2_4/<user>/<domain>/`

Note

`2_4` in the path is an example. You can replace it with the appropriate version, such as `2` or `2_2`.

If these directories do not exist, create them.

Add the Crawler Snippet and optional server variables to the `lscache_vhosts.conf` file. This enables the crawler for this virtual host only.

Apply these changes by running the following command:

```
/scripts/ensure_vhost_includes --user=<user>
```

#### Plesk[¶](#plesk "Permanent link")

##### Server level[¶](#server-level_1 "Permanent link")

Change your working directory to:

- `/etc/httpd/conf.d/` for CentOS
- `/etc/apache2/conf.d/` for Debian
- `/etc/apache2/conf-enabled/` for Ubuntu

Add the Crawler Snippet and optional server variables to `lscache.conf`. If it does not exist, create it.

##### Global virtual host level[¶](#global-virtual-host-level_1 "Permanent link")

Change your working directory to `/usr/local/psa/admin/conf/templates/custom/domain`.

Create the directory if it does not exist.

Copy `/usr/local/psa/admin/conf/templates/default/domain/domainVirtualHost.php` to this location.

Edit the file and add the Crawler Snippet and optional server variables after the `mod_suexec.c` block.

Reconfigure all virtual hosts. This regenerates configuration files for all virtual hosts:

```
/usr/local/psa/admin/bin/httpdmng --reconfigure-all
```

##### Individual virtual host level[¶](#individual-virtual-host-level_1 "Permanent link")

Change your working directory to `/var/www/vhosts/system/<domain_name>/conf/`.

Create a file called `vhost.conf`, or `vhost_ssl.conf` for HTTPS sites, if it does not already exist.

Add the Crawler Snippet and optional server variables to this file.

Reconfigure this virtual host. This regenerates configuration files for this virtual host:

```
/usr/local/psa/admin/bin/httpdmng --reconfigure-domain <domain_name>
```

#### DirectAdmin[¶](#directadmin "Permanent link")

##### Server level[¶](#server-level_2 "Permanent link")

Add the Crawler Snippet and optional server variables to `/etc/httpd/conf/extra/httpd-includes.conf`.

##### Global virtual host level[¶](#global-virtual-host-level_2 "Permanent link")

Create a `/usr/local/directadmin/data/templates/custom/cust_httpd.CUSTOM.2.pre` file and add the Crawler Snippet and optional server variables to it.

Apply these changes to all virtual hosts by running the following commands:

```
cd /usr/local/directadmin/custombuild
./build rewrite_confs
```

### LiteSpeed Native[¶](#litespeed-native "Permanent link")

The cache crawler is enabled by default in an LSWS Native environment.

To disable it at the server level, you need to use LSWS 5.4 or above. This version added the **Cache Features** function to control it.

In the LSWS WebAdmin interface, navigate to **LSWS Admin > Configuration > Server > Cache**. In **Cache Features**, check `On`, uncheck `Crawler`, check `ESI`, and uncheck `Not Set`.

If **Not Set** is checked, the other three values will be ignored and the default values will be used. By default, all three are checked.

[![Cache Features settings in LSWS WebAdmin](../images/admin-disable-crawler-lsws-native-1.png)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/images/admin-disable-crawler-lsws-native-1.png)

To disable the cache crawler at the LSWS Native virtual host level, navigate to **LSWS Admin > Configuration > Virtual Host > VH Name > Cache** and set **Cache Features** in the same manner as above. If **Not Set** is checked, the other three values will be ignored and the server-level configuration will be inherited.

Warning

Do not set **Enable LiteMage** to `On`, as this setting will also enable the crawler, even if **Crawler** is unchecked.

[![Cache Features settings for a virtual host](../images/admin-disable-crawler-lsws-native-vh-1.png)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/images/admin-disable-crawler-lsws-native-vh-1.png)

To add optional server variables, navigate to **Server > External App** and add the variables to the **Environment** setting, one per line. For example:

```
CRAWLER_USLEEP=1000
CRAWLER_LOAD_LIMIT=5.2
```

[![Crawler environment variables](../images/admin-lscwp-admin-crawler.png)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/images/admin-lscwp-admin-crawler.png)

### Verifying crawler status[¶](#verifying-crawler-status "Permanent link")

To determine whether the crawler is enabled or disabled, check the `phpinfo` page and look at the value of the `X-LSCACHE` server variable. If the variable contains `crawler`, the crawler is enabled at the server level. If it does not, as in the example and screenshot below, the crawler is disabled at the server level.

```
$_SERVER['X-LSCACHE'] on,esi
```

[![X-LSCACHE value on the phpinfo page](../images/admin-disable-crawler-lsws-native-phpinfo-1.png)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/images/admin-disable-crawler-lsws-native-phpinfo-1.png)

Tip

The `X-LSCACHE` server variable controls only LiteSpeed’s own crawler. Third-party crawlers do not use the value of `X-LSCACHE` and cannot be controlled that way.

You can also check the crawler status in the LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress plugin. Navigate to **Crawler > Summary**. If **Crawler Cron** is set to `Disable` and you see the following warning, the crawler is disabled at the server level:

```
Warning: The crawler feature is not enabled on the LiteSpeed server. Please consult your server admin.
```

## Changing your cache storage location[¶](#changing-your-cache-storage-location "Permanent link")

If you would like to change where LiteSpeed stores your cached content, use the `LITESPEED_DATA_FOLDER` constant.

Example

To set your cache storage directory to `cache/litespeed`, add the following line to your `wp-config.php` file:

```
define('LITESPEED_DATA_FOLDER', 'cache/litespeed');
```

## Replacing WordPress cron[¶](#replacing-wordpress-cron "Permanent link")

WordPress cron controls the publishing of scheduled posts and the running of LiteSpeed’s QUIC.cloud optimization queues, among other things.

WP-Cron runs when PHP is triggered. To speed up your site, LiteSpeed Cache aims to *minimize* PHP usage. Avoiding PHP is good for performance, but it can delay scheduled tasks.

We recommend taking control of the WP-Cron system away from PHP and giving it to your system cron instead.

Here’s how to set that up in cPanel:

### Disable WP-Cron[¶](#disable-wp-cron "Permanent link")

Add the following to your site’s `wp-config.php` file:

```
define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);
```

This tells WordPress not to run cron automatically when PHP is triggered.

### Add a new job to system cron[¶](#add-a-new-job-to-system-cron "Permanent link")

In cPanel, navigate to **Tools > Advanced > Cron Jobs**.

Under **Common Settings**, choose one of the predefined intervals. We recommend `Once Per Five Minutes (*/5 * * * *)`, but you can run it more or less frequently.

Set **Command** to:

```
wget -q -O - https://example.com/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron >/dev/null 2>&1
```

Press the **Add New Cron Job** button.

You’ve now set `wp-cron` to run every five minutes for the `example.com` domain.

Tip

There are several ways to run `wp-cron`, but to avoid negating the benefits of our caching system, we recommend using `wget` instead of WP-CLI or PHP CLI.

### Debug[¶](#debug "Permanent link")

In some cases, a strict security system may block a WP-Cron request. To test whether this is happening on `example.com`, run this command, replacing `USERNAME` with your cPanel username:

```
wget -O /dev/null https://example.com/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron >> /home/<username>/cron.log 2>&1
```

Check the `/home/<username>/cron.log` file and make sure the HTTP response header returns `200 OK`.

## Setting up CloudFront CDN[¶](#setting-up-cloudfront-cdn "Permanent link")

### Create a CDN with CloudFront[¶](#create-a-cdn-with-cloudfront "Permanent link")

[![CloudFront CDN setup](../images/admin-cloudfront-1.png)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/images/admin-cloudfront-1.png)

1. Set up [AWS CloudFront CDN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/GettingStarted.html).
2. Get your CloudFront **Domain Name**.
3. Make sure your site can be visited directly through the CloudFront **Domain Name**.

### Set up in the LSCache plugin[¶](#set-up-in-the-lscache-plugin "Permanent link")

1. From the WordPress dashboard, navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache > CDN > CDN Settings**.
2. Set **Use CDN Mapping** to `ON`.
3. Enter your CloudFront domain name as the **CDN URL**.
4. Enable the relevant **Include** buttons, such as **Images** and **CSS**. For this example, since we do not include JavaScript, remove `.js` from **Include File Types**.
5. Set **Original URL** to your original domain name, including a subfolder if you are using one.

### Verify[¶](#verify_1 "Permanent link")

Check that the CSS is served from CloudFront:

[![CSS served from CloudFront](../images/admin-cloudfront-3.png)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/images/admin-cloudfront-3.png)

Check that the JavaScript is served from the original domain:

[![JavaScript served from the original domain](../images/admin-cloudfront-2.png)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/images/admin-cloudfront-2.png)

## Turning WordPress shortcodes into ESI blocks[¶](#turning-wordpress-shortcodes-into-esi-blocks "Permanent link")

You can turn WordPress shortcodes into ESI blocks with LiteSpeed Cache. This allows you to cache the contents of a shortcode *in a different way* from the rest of the page. To learn more about ESI, see [our blog post](https://blog.litespeedtech.com/2017/09/06/wpw-esi-and-litespeed-cache/).

If you have a `mycalendar` shortcode, for example, that inserts a calendar into your page, you might use it like this:

```
[mycalendar month="November" year="2018"]
```

To turn it into an ESI block, use it like this:

```
[esi mycalendar month="November" year="2018"]
```

By default, shortcode contents are stored in public cache, and the TTL defaults to the value stored in **LiteSpeed Cache > Cache > TTL > Default Public Cache TTL**. You can change this with a few parameters. To store the shortcode contents in private cache for five minutes (or 300 seconds), use:

```
[esi mycalendar month="November" year="2018" cache="private" ttl="300"]
```

### Limitations[¶](#limitations "Permanent link")

While LiteSpeed Cache can *cache* shortcode contents, it cannot *purge* them on demand. Shortcode ESI blocks expire when the TTL is reached, but specific events cannot trigger a purge. LiteSpeed cannot know which events should trigger a purge because different shortcodes have different events that make their contents outdated.

For example, the following shortcode caches the `mycalendar` block for the same length of time as your site’s default TTL:

```
[esi mycalendar month="November" year="2018"]
```

If someone edits an event before the TTL is reached, the ESI block may be out of date.

There are two ways to handle this issue:

- Ask the shortcode plugin’s author to use our API to trigger a purge when block content changes.
- Use a short TTL and accept that the content may be out of date briefly.

#### Get the plugin author involved[¶](#get-the-plugin-author-involved "Permanent link")

If it is important for specific events to purge the shortcode contents, share [this API call](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lsws/lscache/lscwp/api/#purge-a-cache-tag) with the shortcode plugin’s author. Replace `mycalendar` with the actual name of the shortcode you want to purge:

```
do_action( 'litespeed_purge', 'esi.mycalendar' );
```

This is the most precise way to keep shortcode content up to date and cached according to the shortcode’s requirements.

#### Do it yourself[¶](#do-it-yourself "Permanent link")

If it is not critical for shortcode content to be accurate up to the minute, use the `ttl` parameter to cache it for a short time. If you can live with content that is an hour old, set `ttl="3600"`. If you prefer five minutes, set it to `ttl="300"`.

You can set the content not to be cached by using `ttl="0"`, but this is not recommended. Any time a page contains uncached content, PHP must be invoked to generate it. PHP uses valuable resources and significantly slows down a page. It is better to cache your content for a short time than not to cache it at all.

## Cookies and cache[¶](#cookies-and-cache "Permanent link")

The relationship between cookies and caching can be easily misunderstood. When people talk about “caching cookies” or “not caching cookies,” they usually mean that pages are or are not cached based on whether a user has certain cookies stored. The cookies themselves are not cached.

Cookies are generally ignored unless you specify otherwise. They become important when they affect the user experience.

### Cookies set or read by WordPress[¶](#cookies-set-or-read-by-wordpress "Permanent link")

If a cookie must be set or read by WordPress, the page must be excluded from cache. If the cookie is set on your site (that is, it is not set somewhere before arriving at your site), you must also exclude the page that sets the cookie’s value.

Example

Suppose your site is part of an affiliate network. When a user arrives at `example.com/affiliate_home`, an `aff-example` cookie is set. As the user navigates the site, the cookie is updated with tracking information.

In this case, add the `aff-example` cookie to the **Do Not Cache Cookies** list under **LiteSpeed Cache > Cache > Excludes**. Also add `^/affiliate_home` to the **Do Not Cache URIs** list on the same page. For more information about the **Excludes** page, see [the screen-by-screen documentation](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lsws/lscache/lscwp/cache/#excludes-tab).

If the cookie is set at `example.com/affiliate_home` but never referenced again, you do not need to exclude it from cache.

Alternatively, if the cookie is set offsite but used for tracking as the visitor browses your site, exclude the cookie from cache, but you do not need to exclude the `^/affiliate_home` URI.

### Cookies that indicate variations[¶](#cookies-that-indicate-variations "Permanent link")

Sometimes cookies provide important information about a user to WordPress to help determine what content to show. In these cases, you can use cookies to create cache varies. When LSCache varies on a cookie, it caches separate public versions of pages based on the cookie’s value.

Example

Suppose your WordPress site is a shop with special pricing for friends, activated when they visit `example.com/friends_home`. That page sets a `myfriend` cookie. From then on, every page they visit in your shop shows prices that are 20% lower than usual. Visitors without the `myfriend` cookie see regular prices.

Because the cookie is set on the `example.com/friends_home` page, exclude that URI from cache as described above.

There are two ways to handle the cookie:

- Exclude it from cache, as in the previous example. This is the easiest option, but it means your friends will always receive uncached content.
- Create a cache vary based on the `myfriend` cookie.

#### Configuring a cookie cache vary[¶](#configuring-a-cookie-cache-vary "Permanent link")

Example

Suppose you have a WooCommerce site with a `woocommerce_products_per_page` cookie. Some users have a value of `10`, others have `100`, and still others have `200`. These scenarios require three different views.

There are two ways to handle different views based on a cookie value:

##### JavaScript[¶](#javascript "Permanent link")

The more efficient option is to find a JavaScript-based solution. A JavaScript plugin would need to store only one copy of the page and would build the display based on whether the cookie exists.

##### Rewrite rules[¶](#rewrite-rules "Permanent link")

If you prefer a rewrite rule-based solution, configure the site to vary on the cookie by adding the following rule to your site’s `.htaccess` file:

```
<IfModule LiteSpeed>
    CacheLookup on
    RewriteRule .* - [E=Cache-Vary:woocommerce_products_per_page]
</IfModule>
```

When a user visits your WooCommerce site, the `woocommerce_products_per_page=xxxxxx` cookie is created. The rewrite rule makes the cache vary on that cookie, so the cache stores multiple copies: one for every value of the cookie that requests the page.

Warning

`woocommerce_products_per_page` is an example. Replace it with the appropriate cookie name.

## Memcached, LSMCD, and Redis (object cache) support in LSCWP[¶](#memcached-lsmcd-and-redis-object-cache-support-in-lscwp "Permanent link")

LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress supports object caching.

### What is an object cache?[¶](#what-is-an-object-cache "Permanent link")

An object cache stores the results of expensive or frequent database queries so they can be retrieved easily without repeatedly accessing the database. Object caching greatly reduces the time it takes to retrieve query results.

For example, your WordPress site’s options, such as its name and URL, are stored in the database. Every time WordPress assembles a page for a visitor, it must access the database to read those options. These repeated queries use resources. With an object cache, WordPress can query the database once and save the results for a set period. While the results remain cached, WordPress can retrieve them from the cache when assembling a page. Accessing the object cache uses fewer resources than accessing a database.

Object caching can improve performance for both time-consuming and frequently repeated queries.

Note

If LSCWP fully caches a site, object caching may not be used often. Object caching is needed when WordPress builds a page through PHP. If PHP is not invoked, there are no queries to process or retrieve from the object cache.

### How to set up object cache support[¶](#how-to-set-up-object-cache-support "Permanent link")

LSCWP does not provide object caching directly. Instead, it supports external object caches such as [Memcached](http://memcached.org/about), [LSMCD](https://www.litespeedtech.com/open-source/litespeed-memcached), and Redis.

#### Install Memcached, LSMCD, or Redis and the PHP extension[¶](#install-memcached-lsmcd-or-redis-and-the-php-extension "Permanent link")

You need a working, tested installation of Redis, Memcached, or LSMCD, as well as the related PHP extension (such as `php-memcached` or `php-redis`) for object caching to work with WordPress.

See the following for additional instructions:

- [Installing Memcached or LSMCD and php-memcached](https://www.litespeedtech.com/support/wiki/doku.php/litespeed_wiki:lsmcd:install-memcached)
- [Integrate Redis with WordPress through LSCWP](#integrate-redis-with-wordpress)
- [Using Memcached in a UNIX socket](#using-memcached-in-a-unix-socket)
- [Using Redis in a UNIX socket](#using-redis-in-a-unix-socket)

#### Configure object cache in LSCWP[¶](#configure-object-cache-in-lscwp "Permanent link")

If you use LSMCD, Memcached, or Redis, you can configure LSCWP support in the Cache Settings tab. Navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache > Cache > Object**. Enter the required parameters, including where your Memcached or LSMCD service is located, which objects you want to cache, and how long you want to cache them.

Default values are provided before you enable object caching.

After you enable object caching, the LSCache plugin automatically tests the connection and detects the Memcached or Redis extension.

Find detailed instructions for these settings [here](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lsws/lscache/lscwp/cache/#object-tab).

#### Set a custom prefix (optional)[¶](#set-a-custom-prefix-optional "Permanent link")

The LiteSpeed Cache plugin supports object cache prefixes, which prevent users on a server from reading keys belonging to other sites on the same server. By default, we generate keys based on the MD5 sum of the site’s path. You can define a custom prefix for a site by setting the `LSOC_PREFIX` variable.

Example

To give a site an object cache prefix of `ABC`, add the following line to the site’s `wp-config.php` file:

```
define('LSOC_PREFIX', 'ABC');
```

### How to verify[¶](#how-to-verify "Permanent link")

To check the object cache log, set **LiteSpeed Cache > Toolbox > Debug Settings > Debug Log** to `ON` or `Admin IP`, then view your page source. You should see something like this at the bottom of the code:

```
<!-- Object Cache [total] 5190 [hit_incall] 5056 [hit] 6 [miss_incall] 21 [miss] 107 [set] 171 -->
```

- `total` is the total number of objects requested by the page.
- `hit_incall` is the number of objects that missed Memcached but hit the runtime data from above.
- `hit` is the number of objects retrieved from Memcached.
- `miss_incall` is the number of objects not set in runtime when PHP reached the current line.
- `miss` is the number of objects not found in Memcached.
- `set` is the number of objects set in Memcached.

### How to debug[¶](#how-to-debug "Permanent link")

If your connection test shows `Failed`, try the following:

1. Run `service memcached status` to make sure the service is active.
2. Run `ss -lptun | grep 11211` to make sure the Memcached port is listening.
3. Run `telnet localhost 11211` to make sure you can connect to localhost successfully.

### Test files[¶](#test-files "Permanent link")

You can create PHP test files to test the connection.

For Memcached:

```
<?php

$conn = new Memcached();
$address = '/path/to/memcached.sock'; // Set the address here.
$port = 0; // Set the port.
$conn->addServer($address, $port);
var_dump($address);
var_dump($port);
var_dump($conn->getStats());
echo '<hr>';
var_dump($conn->getServerList());
?>
```

For Redis:

```
<?php

$cfg_host = 'redis address';
$cfg_port = '6379'; // Use 0 for a socket.
$cfg_pswd = ''; // Set a password if required.
$cfg_db = 0;

$conn = new Redis();
$conn->connect($cfg_host, $cfg_port);
if ($cfg_pswd) {
    $conn->auth($cfg_pswd);
}
if ($cfg_db) {
    $conn->select($cfg_db);
}

var_dump($conn->ping()); // Should return `+PONG`.
?>
```

## Integrate Redis with WordPress[¶](#integrate-redis-with-wordpress "Permanent link")

Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. LSCache provides full-page caching, so it can be useful to run Redis alongside it. This guide applies with or without a control panel.

### Install the Redis daemon[¶](#install-the-redis-daemon "Permanent link")

#### CentOS 7[¶](#centos-7 "Permanent link")

1. Add the EPEL repository:

   ```
   yum install epel-release
   ```
2. Install Redis:

   ```
   yum install redis
   ```
3. Start Redis:

   ```
   systemctl start redis
   ```

#### Ubuntu[¶](#ubuntu "Permanent link")

1. Install Redis:

   ```
   apt install redis
   ```
2. Start Redis:

   ```
   systemctl start redis-server
   ```

### Install the Redis PHP extension[¶](#install-the-redis-php-extension "Permanent link")

The `phpredis` extension provides an API for communicating with the Redis key-value store.

#### cPanel EasyApache 4 and CentOS[¶](#cpanel-easyapache-4-and-centos "Permanent link")

The following commands work for CentOS 8 and 7:

```
/opt/cpanel/ea-php72/root/usr/bin/pecl install redis
echo 'extension=redis.so' > /opt/cpanel/ea-php72/root/etc/php.d/redis.ini
```

Alternatively, navigate to **WHM > Module Installer**, choose **PHP Pecl**, select the appropriate PHP version, and install the extension there.

Tip

Replace `ea-php72` with the PHP version you want to install the extension for.

To install the extension for all available PHP versions with a single block of code, see [these instructions from BigScoots](https://help.bigscoots.com/en/articles/512508-cpanel-easyapache-4-installing-redis-and-redis-php-extension).

#### Plesk[¶](#plesk_1 "Permanent link")

Plesk generally supports the `php-redis` extension. If your Plesk version does not support `php-redis` by default, see [the following instructions at Plesk](https://talk.plesk.com/threads/redis-activation-installation-problems-plesk-onyx.342245/).

#### DirectAdmin[¶](#directadmin_1 "Permanent link")

1. DirectAdmin CustomBuild 2 will install `phpxx` in `/usr/local/phpxx`. Go to the version you want, such as `php73`, to build `php-redis` through `pecl`:

   ```
   cd /usr/local/php73/bin
   ./pecl install igbinary igbinary-devel
   ./pecl install redis
   ```
2. Check the extension path:

   ```
   ll /usr/local/php73/lib/php/extensions/
   ```

   Example output:

   ```
   drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 76 Mar 3 14:05 no-debug-non-zts-20180731
   ```
3. Add both `igbinary.so` and `redis.so` to a newly created `10-directadmin.ini` file:

   ```
   vi /usr/local/php73/lib/php.conf.d/10-directadmin.ini
   ```

   Add these lines to the file:

   ```
   extension=/usr/local/php73/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20180731/redis.so
   extension=/usr/local/php73/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20180731/igbinary.so
   ```
4. Restart LSPHP to apply the change:

   ```
   killall -9 lsphp
   ```

#### Without a control panel[¶](#without-a-control-panel "Permanent link")

1. Add the LiteSpeed repository.

   For CentOS 7:

   ```
   rpm -ivh https://rpms.litespeedtech.com/centos/litespeed-repo-1.3-1.el7.noarch.rpm
   ```

   For CentOS 8:

   ```
   rpm -ivh https://rpms.litespeedtech.com/centos/litespeed-repo-1.3-1.el8.noarch.rpm
   ```
2. List the LiteSpeed Redis PHP extensions:

   ```
   yum list | awk '/lsphp/&&/redis/'
   ```
3. Install PHP, substituting your LSPHP version if it differs:

   ```
   yum -y install lsphp71-pecl-redis
   ```

### Verify the installation[¶](#verify-the-installation "Permanent link")

1. Verify that Redis is running with `redis-cli`. If it is running, the command returns `PONG`:

   ```
   redis-cli ping
   ```
2. Verify the installation using the LiteSpeed default PHP info page, `http://192.0.2.1:8088/phpinfo.php`. Look for the **Redis Support** section.

### Try the `redis-benchmark` utility[¶](#try-the-redis-benchmark-utility "Permanent link")

A typical example would be:

```
redis-benchmark -q -n 100000
```

Example output:

```
PING_INLINE: 31826.86 requests per second
PING_BULK: 31595.58 requests per second
SET: 33568.31 requests per second
GET: 31908.10 requests per second
INCR: 32647.73 requests per second
LPUSH: 31220.73 requests per second
RPUSH: 31565.66 requests per second
LPOP: 31555.70 requests per second
```

To run one million `SET` operations, using a random key for every operation from 100,000 possible keys, use:

```
redis-cli flushall
redis-benchmark -t set -r 100000 -n 1000000
```

**Warning:** `redis-cli flushall` deletes all keys from all databases. Do not run it on a Redis server containing data you need to keep.

Example output:

```
====== SET ======
  1000000 requests completed in 32.43 seconds
  50 parallel clients
  3 bytes payload
  keep alive: 1
99.98% <= 10 milliseconds
99.99% <= 11 milliseconds
99.99% <= 12 milliseconds
100.00% <= 17 milliseconds
30833.75 requests per second
```

### Other settings[¶](#other-settings "Permanent link")

- If you want to set up master-slave replication, you may need to enable the firewall for port `6379`:

  ```
  firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=6379/tcp
  firewall-cmd --reload
  ```
- To start Redis automatically at boot:

  ```
  systemctl enable redis
  ```
- To enable disk persistence, edit `/etc/redis.conf` and set:

  ```
  appendonly yes
  appendfsync everysec
  ```

## Using Memcached in a UNIX socket[¶](#using-memcached-in-a-unix-socket "Permanent link")

Memcached can run in a UNIX socket, which may provide better performance than a TCP connection.

Note

If Memcached fails to start, it is usually due to permission or user issues. Run the following instructions as root, and verify that the socket path is writable by the designated user.

### CentOS 7.x[¶](#centos-7x "Permanent link")

1. Stop Memcached:

   ```
   systemctl stop memcached
   ```
2. Copy the service file:

   ```
   cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/memcached.service /etc/systemd/system/memcached.service
   ```
3. Add the following content to `/etc/systemd/system/memcached.service`. After `[Service]`, change the username to the same user that runs PHP. The contents of the file should look like this:

   ```
   User=<username>
   Group=<username>
   ```

   [![Memcached service file configuration](../images/admin-object-cache3.jpg)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/images/admin-object-cache3.jpg)
4. Edit `/etc/sysconfig/memcached`, changing the path to your desired location and the username to the same one used in step 3. Change `OPTIONS="" USER="memcached"` to:

   ```
   OPTIONS="-s /path/to/memcached.sock -a 0770" USER="<username>"
   ```
5. Start Memcached again:

   ```
   systemctl start memcached
   ```
6. Verify that it started successfully:

   ```
   systemctl status memcached
   ```
7. Check that it is working:

   ```
   nc -U /path/to/memcached.sock stats
   ```
8. If you still have permission issues, check the SELinux status:

   ```
   getenforce
   ```
9. If the status is `Enforcing`, temporarily set SELinux to permissive mode:

   ```
   setenforce 0
   ```

   A reboot will re-enable SELinux.
10. To permanently change SELinux mode, edit `/etc/selinux/config`, change `enforcing` to `permissive` or `disabled`, and reboot.

### CentOS 6.x[¶](#centos-6x "Permanent link")

1. Stop Memcached:

   ```
   systemctl stop memcached
   ```
2. Edit `/etc/sysconfig/memcached` and change `OPTIONS="" USER=""` to `OPTIONS="-s /path/to/memcached.sock -a 0770" USER="<username>"`, where `<username>` is the user that runs PHP.
3. Start Memcached:

   ```
   service memcached start
   ```
4. Check that it is working:

   ```
   nc -U /path/to/memcached.sock stats
   ```
5. If you still have permission issues, check the SELinux status:

   ```
   getenforce
   ```
6. If the status is `Enforcing`, temporarily set SELinux to permissive mode:

   ```
   setenforce 0
   ```

   A reboot will re-enable SELinux.
7. To permanently change SELinux mode, edit `/etc/selinux/config`, change `enforcing` to `permissive` or `disabled`, and reboot.

### Ubuntu 17.10, Ubuntu 16.04, Debian 8, and Debian 9[¶](#ubuntu-1710-ubuntu-1604-debian-8-and-debian-9 "Permanent link")

1. Stop Memcached:

   ```
   systemctl stop memcached
   ```
2. Edit `/etc/memcached.conf`, comment out the host and port, add the socket path and permission `-s /path/to/memcached.sock -a 0770`, and change `-u memcache` to `-u <username>`, where `<username>` is the user that runs PHP.
3. Start Memcached again:

   ```
   systemctl start memcached
   ```
4. Check that it is working:

   ```
   nc -U /path/to/memcached.sock stats
   ```

### Ubuntu 14.04 and Debian 7[¶](#ubuntu-1404-and-debian-7 "Permanent link")

1. Stop Memcached:

   ```
   service memcached stop
   ```
2. Edit `/etc/memcached.conf`, comment out the host and port, add the socket path and permission `-s /path/to/memcached.sock -a 0770`, and change `-u memcache` to `-u <username>`, where `<username>` is the user that runs PHP.
3. Start Memcached again:

   ```
   service memcached start
   ```
4. Check that it is working:

   ```
   nc -U /path/to/memcached.sock stats
   ```

## Using Redis in a UNIX socket[¶](#using-redis-in-a-unix-socket "Permanent link")

Run the following instructions as root. If Redis fails to start, verify that SELinux is disabled and that all mentioned directories and files have the correct permissions for the designated user.

### CentOS 7.x[¶](#centos-7x_1 "Permanent link")

1. Stop Redis:

   ```
   systemctl stop redis
   ```
2. Copy the service file:

   ```
   cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/redis.service /etc/systemd/system/redis.service
   ```
3. Edit `/etc/systemd/system/redis.service` and set `User` and `Group` to the same user that runs PHP. Replace `username` with that user:

   ```
   User=username
   Group=username
   ```
4. Edit `/etc/redis.conf` and make the following changes. Change `port` to `0` if a TCP socket is no longer needed:

   ```
   unixsocket /path/to/redis.sock
   unixsocketperm 770
   logfile /path/to/redis.log
   dir /path/to/redis
   ```
5. Change the owner of `redis.conf` to the same username used in step 3:

   ```
   chown username:group /etc/redis.conf
   ```

   If `/path/to/redis` does not exist, create it manually. Make sure the designated user can write to the socket path, log path, and data directory.
6. Start Redis:

   ```
   systemctl start redis
   ```
7. Verify that it started successfully:

   ```
   systemctl status redis
   ```
8. Check that it is working:

   ```
   nc -U /path/to/redis.sock info
   ```
