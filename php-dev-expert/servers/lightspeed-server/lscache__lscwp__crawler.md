# Crawler[¶](#crawler "Permanent link")

The crawler travels through your site, refreshing pages that have expired in the cache. This makes it less likely that your visitors will encounter uncached pages.

The crawler must be enabled at the server level or the virtual host level by a site admin. Please see: [Enabling the Crawler at the Server or Virtual Host Level](lscache__lscwp__admin.md#enabling-the-crawler)

### Crawler Cron[¶](#crawler-cron "Permanent link")

See the progress of the various crawlers enabled for your site. You can monitor the progress of each crawler via the color-coded rectangles in the **Status** column.

Note

Crawlers cannot run concurrently. If you have multiple crawlers defined, they will run one at a time.

Use the **Reset Position** button to start the crawler at the beginning again.

Use the **Manually run** button to start the crawler without waiting for the cron job.

#### Status key[¶](#status-key "Permanent link")

- Gray, **Waiting to be Crawled**: The page is in the queue to be crawled.
- Green, **Cache Hit**: The page is already cached, so the crawler skipped it.
- Blue, **Cache Miss**: The page was not already cached, so the crawler has cached it.
- Red, **Blocklisted**: The page cannot be crawled. See the [Blocklist](#blocklist) section for more information.

### Watch Crawler Status[¶](#watch-crawler-status "Permanent link")

If you've opted to watch the crawler status, your screen will look something like the image below. The messages in the status window will vary from site to site.

[![Watch Crawler Status](../images/crawler02.jpg)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/images/crawler02.jpg)

Here is an explanation of some of the terms:

- `Size`: The number of URLs in the sitemap. This example has 181.
- `Crawler`: Indicates which crawler number you are watching. It's number 1 in this example. There could be multiple crawlers working, depending on your settings.
- `Position`: The URL number currently being fetched from the sitemap list.
- `Threads`: Indicates the number of threads currently being used to fetch URLs. There may be multiple threads fetching. It is smart and will adjust based on your load [settings](#server-load-limit).
- `Status`: Indicates the current crawler status. In this example, `Stopped due to reset meta position` means that the site purged or the sitemap changed while it was crawling, and as such, the crawler will restart from the top.

## Map tab[¶](#map-tab "Permanent link")

[![LSCWP Crawler Map tab](../images/crawler03.png)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/images/crawler03.png)

### Sitemap List[¶](#sitemap-list "Permanent link")

This page displays the URIs currently in the crawler map. If you don't see any listed, try pressing the **Refresh Crawler Map** button.

You can search for a particular URL, which is helpful if your sitemap is large.

[![LSCWP Crawler Map tab](../images/crawler04.png)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/images/crawler04.png)

You can filter your URL list to only display those with a particular cache status (`Cache Hit` or `Cache Miss`) or those that have been added to the blocklist (`Blocklisted`). Click the corresponding link to do so.

You can manually add URIs to the blocklist via the button next to each entry.

The **Crawler Status** column uses colored dots to give you the status of each URI. See below the table for the key.

To start from scratch with the crawler map, press the **Clean Crawler Map** button.

## Blocklist tab[¶](#blocklist-tab "Permanent link")

[![LSCWP Crawler Blocklist tab](../images/crawler05.png)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/images/crawler05.png)

### Blocklist[¶](#blocklist "Permanent link")

This page displays the URIs currently in the blocklist.

From here, you can manually remove URIs from the blocklist via the button next to each entry.

The **Status** column uses colored dots to give you the status of each URI. See below the table for the key.

To start from scratch and clear out the blocklist, press the **Empty Blocklist** button.

## Settings tab[¶](#settings-tab "Permanent link")

[![LSCWP Crawler Settings tab](../images/crawler06.png)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/images/crawler06.png)

### Crawler[¶](#crawler_1 "Permanent link")

*OFF*

Set **Crawler** to `ON` to enable crawling for this site.

### Delay[¶](#delay "Permanent link")

The crawler sends requests to the backend, one page after another, as it traverses your site. This can put a heavy load on your server if there is no pause between requests. The **Delay** setting, in microseconds, lets LSCache know how often to send a new request to the server.

This setting may be limited at the server level. Learn more about [limiting the crawler's impact on the server](lscache__lscwp__admin.md#limiting-the-crawler).

Info

This setting has been deprecated in LSCWP v7. **Delay** is now set to `500` microseconds by default. If you wish to adjust this value, please add a line similar to this to your `wp-config.php` file, where `$delay` is the number of microseconds you wish to set **Delay** to:

```
define('LITESPEED_CRAWLER_USLEEP', $delay);
```

### Run Duration[¶](#run-duration "Permanent link")

In order to keep your server from getting bogged down with behind-the-scenes crawling, we put limits on the crawling duration. This setting has been deprecated in LSCWP v7. **Run Duration** is now set to a maximum of 900 seconds and is not editable.

### Interval Between Runs[¶](#interval-between-runs "Permanent link")

This setting determines the length of the break mentioned above. By default, the crawler rests for 600 seconds in between every 400-second run.

Info

This setting has been deprecated in LSCWP v7. **Interval Between Runs** is now set to `600` seconds by default. If you wish to adjust this value, please add a line similar to this to your `wp-config.php` file, where `$interval` is the number of seconds you wish to set **Interval Between Runs** to:

```
define('LITESPEED_CRAWLER_RUN_INTERVAL', $interval);
```

### Crawl Interval[¶](#crawl-interval "Permanent link")

*302400*

How often do you want to reinitiate the crawling process? This depends on how long it takes to crawl your site. The best way to figure this out is to run the crawler a couple of times and keep track of the elapsed time. Once you’ve got that amount, set **Crawl Interval** to slightly more than that. For example, if your crawler routinely takes 4 hours to complete a run, you could set the interval to 5 hours, or `18000` seconds.

### Threads[¶](#threads "Permanent link")

When **Threads** is set to the default of `3`, there are three separate crawling processes happening concurrently. The higher the number, the faster your site is crawled, but also the more load that is put on your server.

Info

This setting has been deprecated in LSCWP v7. **Threads** is now set to `3` by default. If you wish to adjust this value, please add a line similar to this to your `wp-config.php` file, where `$threads` is the number you wish to set **Threads** to:

```
define('LITESPEED_CRAWLER_THREADS', $threads);
```

### Timeout[¶](#timeout "Permanent link")

The crawler has this many seconds to crawl a page before moving on to the next page. The value defaults to `30` seconds.

Info

This setting has been deprecated in LSCWP v7. **Timeout** is now set to `30` seconds by default. If you wish to adjust this value, please add a line similar to this to your `wp-config.php` file, where `$timeout` is the number of seconds you wish to set **Timeout** to:

```
define('LITESPEED_CRAWLER_TIMEOUT', $timeout);
```

### Server Load Limit[¶](#server-load-limit "Permanent link")

*1*

This setting is a way to keep the crawler from monopolizing system resources. Once the server's load average reaches this limit, the crawler will be terminated, rather than allowing it to compromise server performance. Set **Server Load Limit** to `0` to prevent the crawler from running.

Example

To limit the crawler so that it stops running when half of your server resources are being consumed, set **Server Load Limit** to `0.5` for a one-core server, `1` for a two-core server, `2` for a four-core server, and so on.

Note

This setting may be overridden at the server level. Learn more about [limiting the crawler's impact on the server](lscache__lscwp__admin.md#limiting-the-crawler).

### Role Simulation[¶](#role-simulation "Permanent link")

*Empty list*

By default, the crawler runs as a non-logged-in guest on your site. As such, the pages that are cached by the crawler are all for non-logged-in users. If you would like to also pre-cache logged-in views, you may do so here.

The crawler simulates a user account when it runs, so you need to specify user ID numbers that correspond to the roles you'd like to cache.

For security purposes, some restrictions have been enacted for **Role Simulation** as of version 7:

- It may not be run for any user ID that has `Editor` privileges or higher.
- It is limited to the [**Server IP**](lscache__lscwp__general.md#server-ip).

Note

If the server doesn't support port `443`, you can set the `LITESPEED_CRAWLER_LOCAL_PORT` constant to `80`.

Example

To cache pages for users with the `Subscriber` role, choose one user that has the `Subscriber` role, and enter that user's ID in the box.

You may crawl multiple points of view by entering multiple user IDs in the box, one per line.

Note

Only one crawler may run at a time, so if you have specified one or more user IDs in the **Role Simulation** box, first the `Guest` crawler will run, and then the role-based crawlers will run, one after the other.

### Cookie Simulation[¶](#cookie-simulation "Permanent link")

To crawl for a particular cookie, enter the cookie name and the values you wish to crawl for. Values should be one per line and can include a blank line. There will be one crawler created per cookie value per simulated role. Press the **+** button to add additional cookies, but be aware the number of crawlers grows quickly with each new cookie and can be a drain on system resources.

Example

If you crawl for `Guest` and `Administrator` roles, and you add `testcookie1` with the values `A` and `B`, you have 4 crawlers:

1. `Guest`, `testcookie1=A`
2. `Guest`, `testcookie1=B`
3. `Administrator`, `testcookie1=A`
4. `Administrator`, `testcookie1=B`

Add `testcookie2` with the values `C`, `D`, and `<blank>`, and you suddenly have 12 crawlers.

1. `Guest`, `testcookie1=A`, `testcookie2=C`
2. `Guest`, `testcookie1=B`, `testcookie2=C`
3. `Administrator`, `testcookie1=A`, `testcookie2=C`
4. `Administrator`, `testcookie1=B`, `testcookie2=C`
5. `Guest`, `testcookie1=A`, `testcookie2=D`
6. `Guest`, `testcookie1=B`, `testcookie2=D`
7. `Administrator`, `testcookie1=A`, `testcookie2=D`
8. `Administrator`, `testcookie1=B`, `testcookie2=D`
9. `Guest`, `testcookie1=A`, `testcookie2=<blank>`
10. `Guest`, `testcookie1=B`, `testcookie2=<blank>`
11. `Administrator`, `testcookie1=A`, `testcookie2=<blank>`
12. `Administrator`, `testcookie1=B`, `testcookie2=<blank>`

There aren't many situations in which you would need to simulate a cookie crawler, but it can be useful for sites that use a cookie to control multiple languages or currencies.

Example

WPML uses the `_icl_current_language=` cookie to differentiate between visitor languages. An English speaker's cookie would look like `_icl_current_language=EN`, while a Thai speaker's cookie would look like `_icl_current_language=TH`. To crawl your site for a particular language, use a `Guest` user and the appropriate cookie value.

### WCML Multi-currency Crawl[¶](#wcml-multi-currency-crawl "Permanent link")

[![WCML Multi-currency Crawl setting](../images/crawler07.png)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/images/crawler07.png)

This setting appears as part of the **Cookie Simulation** configuration if you have the WCML plugin installed.

Your site's enabled currencies are listed as options. Check the currencies you wish to crawl. For each currency chosen, the matching `_lscache_vary` cookie is appended to the crawler cookie list automatically. Crawler hits are reverse-mapped back to the selected currency at request time.

Note

This setting only applies to guest crawls. Role-simulated crawls use the `role` vary cookie, which overrides the per-currency value.

### Drop Domain from Sitemap[¶](#drop-domain-from-sitemap "Permanent link")

The crawler will parse the sitemap and save it into the database before crawling. When parsing the sitemap, dropping the domain can save DB storage. This setting is enabled by default.

Warning

If you are using multiple domains for one site, and you have multiple domains in the sitemap, please keep this option OFF. Otherwise, the crawler will only crawl one of the domains.

Info

This setting has been deprecated in LSCWP v7. **Drop Domain from Sitemap** is now enabled by default. If you wish to disable it, please add the following line to your `wp-config.php` file:

```
define('LITESPEED_CRAWLER_DROP_DOMAIN', false);
```

### Sitemap Timeout[¶](#sitemap-timeout "Permanent link")

This setting specifies the number of seconds before timing out while parsing the sitemap. It is set to `120` seconds by default.

Info

This setting has been deprecated in LSCWP v7. **Sitemap Timeout** is now set to `120` seconds by default. If you wish to adjust this value, please add a line similar to this to your `wp-config.php` file, where `$timeout` is the number of seconds you wish to set **Sitemap Timeout** to:

```
define('LITESPEED_CRAWLER_MAP_TIMEOUT', $timeout);
```
