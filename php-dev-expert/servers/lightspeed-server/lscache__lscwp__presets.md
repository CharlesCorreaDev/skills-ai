You can use Presets to easily configure your LiteSpeed Cache plugin. When you apply a Preset, your existing settings are backed up, and then replaced with the chosen preset.

Eventually, we hope to include Presets that have been submitted by members of our community. For now, we have these LiteSpeed Cache Standard Presets that were developed by our team. We've included a selection of presets for every comfort level.

To use a preset, press the **Apply Preset** button below your chosen preset and answer **OK** when prompted to continue. Your old settings will be backed up, and the new preset settings will be applied.

Be sure to test your site and make sure everything is working as expected. This is especially important if you've chosen one of the higher-risk presets. If the preset causes a problem, you can revert back to your previous settings via the [**History** section](#history) at the bottom of the tab.
