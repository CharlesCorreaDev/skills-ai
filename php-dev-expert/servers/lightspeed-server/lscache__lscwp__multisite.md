# Multisite Networks[¶](#multisite-networks "Permanent link")

A WordPress multisite network is a collection of WordPress sites that share a single WordPress installation. Each of these sites is called a "subsite."

This is different than simply having multiple independent WordPress sites on your server. In a multisite network, a single admin has the ability to control all of the subsites, and all of the subsites share the same plugins and themes.

To learn more about WordPress multisite networks, please see [the WordPress tutorial](https://learn.wordpress.org/tutorial/introduction-to-wordpress-multisite-networks/).

## Network Admin[¶](#network-admin "Permanent link")

In a WordPress multisite installationimages/multisite\_board has a **My Sites** dropdown on the Admin Bar. The first in the dropdown list is **Network Admin** followed by a list of each of the sites in the network.

Multisite networks share a common `.htaccess` file, which means that any LiteSpeed Cache options that change `.htaccess` must apply to the whole network. These options have been relocated to the **Network Admin** area.

Some other LiteSpeed Cache options will be found only in the **Network Admin** section. This allows for easier setup, and for all of the network subsites to share a common configuration that is maintained at the top level.

All of the LiteSpeed Cache settings listed below can be found at the network level. Anything not listed here is accessible through the network's subsites.

Tip

Any setting you change at the network level will apply to *all subsites*.

### Dashboard[¶](#dashboard "Permanent link")

This area provides a network-level view of the QUIC.cloud usage for all of the subsites in the network. Each site is listed separately. Subsites have their own versions of this section.

### General[¶](#general "Permanent link")

These settings are only at the network level and are not available to subsites:

- **Automatically Upgrade**
- **Use Primary Site Configuration**: This option uses the network's primary site as a template to easily apply settings throughout the entire network. It will overwrite the subsites' configurations with the network-level configuration.
- **Guest Mode**
