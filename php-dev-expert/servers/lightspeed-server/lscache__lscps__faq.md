# Frequently Asked Questions[¶](#frequently-asked-questions "Permanent link")

## Is the LiteSpeed Cache plugin free?[¶](#is-the-litespeed-cache-plugin-free "Permanent link")

Yes, this LSCache plugin will always be free and open source. That said, a LiteSpeed server is required, and there are fees associated with some LiteSpeed server editions.

## What server software is required for this plugin?[¶](#what-server-software-is-required-for-this-plugin "Permanent link")

A LiteSpeed server is required in order to use this plugin. You will need one of the following (any single server or cluster including one of these will work):

- LiteSpeed Web Server Enterprise with LSCache Module (v5.0.10+)
- LiteSpeed WebADC (v2.0+)

## What is the difference between the LSCache Module for LiteSpeed Web Server (requires a license) and the LSCache plugin (free)?[¶](#what-is-the-difference-between-the-lscache-module-for-litespeed-web-server-requires-a-license-and-the-lscache-plugin-free "Permanent link")

The LSCache Module is built into your licensed copy of LiteSpeed Web Server. When it comes to caching dynamic content, the LSCache Module does all of the work.

The LSCache plugin is simply an interface. It allows the web app to instruct the server Module on what to cache, how long to cache it, and when to purge. And it allows the site owner to manage and configure the Module. Without the Module, the Plugin could not function.

A licensed LSCache Module is required in order to use the free LSCache plugin.

## Does this plugin work in a clustered environment?[¶](#does-this-plugin-work-in-a-clustered-environment "Permanent link")

Yes. When using the plugin in a clustered environment, the cache entries are stored at the highest LiteSpeed server level. So, if you are using LiteSpeed's own Web ADC, then the cache can be stored at the ADC level. If you are using a third party load balancer, then the cache entries will only be stored at the backend LiteSpeed nodes, and cache purges will *not* be synchronized across the nodes.

We do not recommend a third party load balancing solution, if you wish to take advantage of LiteSpeed Cache, and keep cache entries synced between nodes.

Note

The rewrite rules created by the LiteSpeed Cache plugin must be copied to the Load Balancer.

## Does LiteSpeed Cache for PrestaShop work with OpenLiteSpeed?[¶](#does-litespeed-cache-for-prestashop-work-with-openlitespeed "Permanent link")

No, OpenLiteSpeed does not support ESI, and ESI is essential to the efficient caching of a PrestaShop store.

## Does LiteSpeed Cache for PrestaShop have a crawler?[¶](#does-litespeed-cache-for-prestashop-have-a-crawler "Permanent link")

Yes, there is a crawler script. You may download the script and get instructions for using it [here](lscache__lscps__settings.md#cache-crawler-script).

## Are there compatibility issues with PrestaShop native caches? Do I need to stop these caches?[¶](#are-there-compatibility-issues-with-prestashop-native-caches-do-i-need-to-stop-these-caches "Permanent link")

LiteSpeed Cache is a page cache. PrestaShop native caches, such as Smarty Cache and File System Cache, are not page caches and therefore will not cause conflict. We recommend that you leave these caches enabled, unless you are debugging.

## What other compatibility issues should I know about?[¶](#what-other-compatibility-issues-should-i-know-about "Permanent link")

LiteSpeed Cache for PrestaShop has been tested to be compatible with the default theme out of the box. Shops running other themes may encounter compatibility issues, which could require extra integration code or customized setup. Please be sure to test the LSCPS plugin before putting it into production with a non-default theme.

## Is there a plan to add other optimization features, as in LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress?[¶](#is-there-a-plan-to-add-other-optimization-features-as-in-litespeed-cache-for-wordpress "Permanent link")

Not at this time. We suggest you continue to use PrestaShop's built-in optimization solutions.

## How can I install the LiteSpeed Cache Plugin?[¶](#how-can-i-install-the-litespeed-cache-plugin "Permanent link")

The LiteSpeed Cache plugin works right out of the box with default settings that are appropriate for most sites. Please refer to the [installation instructions](lscache__lscps__installation.md) to learn how to get started.

## How do I know if LSCache is Working?[¶](#how-do-i-know-if-lscache-is-working "Permanent link")

You can verify that LiteSpeed Cache is working by using the browser's developer tools, as described in [Verify Your Site is Being Cached](lscache__lscps__installation.md#verify-your-site-is-being-cached).
