# 403 Error[¶](#403-error "Permanent link")

Tip

Have you checked your log files? They usually show you the cause of the error!

Error `403 Forbidden` can be triggered by many things, including permission issues, configuration restrictions, security settings, etc. It is rare for the web server to be the cause of a 403 error, but just to be safe, you should rule that out first thing by checking whether the error occurs with Apache as well.

## Does it Occur with Apache?[¶](#does-it-occur-with-apache "Permanent link")

If your server is running on an Apache control panel, such as cPanel or Plesk, there is an easy way to determine whether an issue is caused by your LiteSpeed server:

1. Temporarily switch to Apache
2. Repeat the steps that originally led to the issue.

Are you able to reproduce the error under Apache?

### NO[¶](#no "Permanent link")

If the error could not be triggered under Apache, then the problem is likely to be a LiteSpeed server issue. Please open a ticket from your client area or email `support@litespeedtech.com` and provide as many details as possible, so that we may assist you.

### YES[¶](#yes "Permanent link")

If Apache experiences the same problems, then the issue is not a LiteSpeed Web Server issue.

Switch back to LiteSpeed Web Server, and keep reading! Even though it is not a server problem, we have provided the following troubleshooting documentation that we hope will help you to find the solution.

## File Permissions[¶](#file-permissions "Permanent link")

If the file or directory has the wrong permissions, you may see Error 403. Fix the premissions, and the error goes away.

## Wrong File Owner[¶](#wrong-file-owner "Permanent link")

Make sure that the file or directory belongs to the correct user. Lets say that your `public_html` directory is owned by the username `test`, and you try to create a file `index.php` as user `test1`. That can trigger the error, as test1 will not have permission to read the file or the directory.

## Deny From .htaccess File[¶](#deny-from-htaccess-file "Permanent link")

Your `.htaccess` may have code like this:

```
deny from all
```

or

```
deny from 192.0.2.0
```

This means that access for the website is denied for everyone, or just from 192.0.2.0, respectively. You can simply remove or comment the line out with `#`.

## Rewrite Rule Forbidden[¶](#rewrite-rule-forbidden "Permanent link")

If you have something similar to the following rewrite rule, it may return 403 forbidden:

```
RewriteCond (SOMECONDITION)
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ – [F,L]
```

## Indexes[¶](#indexes "Permanent link")

Directory indexing may be preventing a list of the files for the directory, but if you do not have an index file (`index.php`, `index.html`, etc.) and the **autoindex** option is `ON` that will return error 403.

If you have this line in the `.htaccess` file:

```
Options -Indexes
```

Remove the line, or turn autoindex on:

```
Options +Indexes
```

## Problem/Missing PHP Handler[¶](#problemmissing-php-handler "Permanent link")

If the PHP handler is not set up correctly, the web server will return error 403. This will be shown in the server error log file and you will need to check it for more information. After that, create the correct PHP handler to resolve the issue.

## File Restriction[¶](#file-restriction "Permanent link")

In **Litespeed WebAdmin > Configuration > Server > Security** there is an option called **Restricted Permission Mask**. If you set this to a high value like `644`, you will get error 403 for your pages. To resolve it you need to lower the value.

## Incorrect File Ownership After Migration[¶](#incorrect-file-ownership-after-migration "Permanent link")

When migrating or uploading files to a cPanel account, some image files might incorrectly be assigned to `nobody:nobody`, when they should be `user:user`.

```
/home/jsmith/public_html>ls -ald images/detailed/130/Untitled-1-Recovered_urba-uz.jpg
-rw-rw-rw- 1 nobody nobody 103609 Apr 12 11:21 images/detailed/130/Untitled-1-Recovered_urba-uz.jpg
/home/jsmith/public_html>ls -ald images/detailed/130
drwxrwxrwx 2 nobody nobody 36864 Apr 14 15:12 images/detailed/130
/home/jsmith/public_html>ls -ald images/detailed
drwxrwxrwx 51 jsmith jsmith 4096 Apr 11 13:16 images/detailed
/home/jsmith/public_html>ls -ald images
drwxrwxrwx 48 jsmith jsmith 4096 Mar 31 16:30 images
```

The **Force Strict Ownership** setting in LSWS Admin specifies whether to enforce strict file ownership checking. If it is enabled, the web server will check if the owner of the file being served is the same as the owner of the virtual host. If it is different, a `403 Access Denied` error will be returned.

To fix the problem, either change all files `user:group` to `user:user` ( in the above example, that would be `jsmith:jsmith`), or disable **Force Strict Ownership** in LSWS Admin.

## Firewall Block[¶](#firewall-block "Permanent link")

If Mod Security, WAF, fail2ban, CPHulk, etc. are enabled, depending on what and how many requests you are doing for a particular website, the firewall can block you. In most cases your IP address will be denied in the system firewall (iptables, firewalld etc) and you need to remove your IP address in order to avoid the error.

If mod\_security rules are enabled, they may be triggerred for 403 error. For example:

```
[modsecurity] [Fri Apr 26 10:07:36 2019] [error] [client 192.0.2.0] ModSecurity: Access denied with code 403, [Rule: 'TX:ANOMALY_SCORE' '@ge %{tx.in_example_score_threshold}'] [id "949110"] [msg "Inbound Anomaly Score Exceeded (Total Score: 10)"] [severity "CRITICAL"] [tag "application-multi"] [tag "language-multi"][tag "platform-multi"] [tag "attack-generic"]
```

## Per Client Throttling[¶](#per-client-throttling "Permanent link")

Similar to the previous case, if you have strict throttling rules and you make too many connections, that can trigger error 403. For example, you may use LiteSpeed's **Per Client Throttling** feature and set **Connection Soft Limit** and **Connection Hard Limit**. If any visitor's IP goes over that connection limit, it will trigger a 403 error and show the following in the logs:

```
[NOTICE] [192.0.2.0] bot detected for vhost [N/A], reason: OverConnSoftLimit, close connection
```

or

```
[NOTICE] [192.0.2.0] bot detected for vhost [N/A], reason: OverConnHardLimit, close connection!
```

## reCAPTCHA[¶](#recaptcha "Permanent link")

If a visitor fails on reCAPTCHA verification, it may trigger a 403 error.

## WordPress Protection[¶](#wordpress-protection "Permanent link")

If a visitor hits the LiteSpeed WordPress Protection feature with over-limit connections, it may trigger a 403 error.

## GeoIP/IP2Loc or Similar Modules[¶](#geoipip2loc-or-similar-modules "Permanent link")

If GeoIP or IP2Loc is allowed, they can block access to files like `wp-login` (wp-admin). In this case you need to allow them access in order to avoid the error.

## Error 403 in LiteSpeed WebAdmin[¶](#error-403-in-litespeed-webadmin "Permanent link")

There is an option to restrict access to the WebAdmin. If you forget to add your IP address, or if it changes, you can edit it from the configuration file in `/usr/local/lsws/admin/conf/admin_config.xml`:

```
<security>
 <accessControl>
   <allow>192.0.2.0</allow>
   <deny>ALL</deny>
 </accessControl>
</security>
```

Put your IP address in the allow list. For multiple IP addresses it looks like this:

```
<allow>192.0.2.0,192.0.2.1</allow>
```

## Additional Information[¶](#additional-information "Permanent link")

The best way to diagnose and resolve that error is to check the system configuration, website configuration and the error logs. If you are unsure what is the correct configuration for some option that is triggering error 403, you can check the wiki for that option. For example: For [GeoLocation guide](lsws__cp__cpanel__geoip.md) configuration or [IP2Location guide](lsws__cp__cpanel__geoip.md#enabling-ip2location).
