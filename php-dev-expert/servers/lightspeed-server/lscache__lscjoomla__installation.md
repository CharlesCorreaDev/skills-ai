# Installation[¶](#installation "Permanent link")

Before installing and activating the LSCache plugin, deactivate all other full-page cache plugins.

Tip

You can still use other types of cache (like object cache, or browser cache), but only one full-page cache should be used at a time.

Tip

To avoid a potential conflict with LiteSpeed Web Server, you may want to keep Joomla!'s gzip function `Off`. You'll find this setting in **System > Global Configuration > Server > Gzip Page Compression**.

## Server Configuration[¶](#server-configuration "Permanent link")

Note

Please see the [Overview](lscache__lscjoomla.md#server-level-prerequisites) for the server-level requirements before attempting to install this extension.

Modify the `.htaccess` file in the Joomla! site directory, and add the following directives:

```
<IfModule LiteSpeed>
    CacheLookup on
</IfModule>
```

If your Joomla! site has a separate mobile view, please also add the following:

```
<IfModule LiteSpeed>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} Mobile|Android|Silk/|Kindle|BlackBerry|Opera\ Mini|Opera\ Mobi [NC]
    RewriteRule .* - [E=Cache-Control:vary=ismobile]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} enquiry [NC]
    RewriteRule .* - [E=Cache-Control:no-cache]
</IfModule>
```

## Extension Installation[¶](#extension-installation "Permanent link")

1. Download [the LSCache for Joomla! package](https://www.litespeedtech.com/products/cache-plugins/joomla-acceleration/download) from our site.
2. From the Joomla! Administration menu, navigate to **Extensions > Manage > Install**. [![!](../images/joo-1.png)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscjoomla/images/joo-1.png)
3. Select the **Upload Package File** tab, and drag the zip file into the window, or press the button to browse for the file. [![!](../images/joo-2.png)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscjoomla/images/joo-2.png)
4. The plugin will be automatically installed and enabled.

## Verify the Plugin is Enabled[¶](#verify-the-plugin-is-enabled "Permanent link")

Navigate to **Extensions > Plugins**. If you have a lot of plugins listed, type `LiteSpeed` into the search box to bring up the LiteSpeed Cache Plugin. [![!](../images/lscjoomla-enable.png)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscjoomla/images/lscjoomla-enable.png)

Look for the green check mark next to the plugin name. This indicates that the plugin is installed and enabled. If you see a red X instead, click the red X to enable the plugin. Once you’ve done that, the green check mark should appear, and you are good to go.

If you wish to disable the plugin in the future, you may click the green check mark to toggle it back to the red X.

## Verify Your Site is Being Cached[¶](#verify-your-site-is-being-cached "Permanent link")

### LSCache Check Tool[¶](#lscache-check-tool "Permanent link")

There's a simple way to see if a URL is cached by LiteSpeed: the [LSCache Check](https://check.lscache.io/) Tool.

Enter the URL you wish to check, and the tool will respond with an easy-to-read Yes or No result, and a display of the URL's response headers, in case you want to examine the results more closely.

[![!LSCache Check](/shared/lscache/images/installation-verify01.png)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/shared/lscache/images/installation-verify01.png)

In addition to LSCache support, the tool can detect cache hits, and can detect when sites are using LiteSpeed Web ADC or QUIC.cloud CDN for caching.

Additionally, a Stale Cache Warning will alert you if browser cache is detected on dynamic pages. This is because browser cache may interfere with the delivery of fresh content.

### Manual Lookup[¶](#manual-lookup "Permanent link")

[![!Verify Cache Miss](/shared/lscache/images/installation-verify02.png)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/shared/lscache/images/installation-verify02.png)

You can verify a page is being served from LSCache through the following steps:

1. From a non-logged-in browser, navigate to your site, and open the developer tools (usually, right-click > **Inspect**). Open the **Network** tab.
2. Refresh the page.
3. Click the first resource. This should be an HTML file. For example, if your page is `http://example.com/webapp/`, your first resource should either be something like `example.com/webapp/` or `webapp/`.
4. You should see headings similar to these:

   ```
   X-LiteSpeed-Cache: miss
   X-LiteSpeed-Cache-Control:public,max-age=1800
   X-LiteSpeed-Tag:B1_F,B1_
   ```

   These headings mean the page had not yet been cached, but that LiteSpeed has now stored it, and it will be served from cache with the next request.
5. Reload the page and you should see `X-LiteSpeed-Cache: hit` in the response header. This means the page is being served by LSCache and is configured correctly. [![!Verify Cache Hit](/shared/lscache/images/installation-verify03.png)](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/shared/lscache/images/installation-verify03.png)

Alternative Headers

The `X-LiteSpeed-Cache` header is most common, but you may see `X-LSADC-Cache` if your site is served by LiteSpeed Web ADC.

You may also see `X-QC-Cache` and `X-QC-Pop` if your site is served via QUIC.cloud CDN. The former indicates the cache status (`hit` or `miss`) and the latter indicates what PoP location (such as `NA-US-LGA-33`) served this response.

These alternative headers are also an indication that LSCache is working properly on your site.

Important

If you don't see `X-LiteSpeed-Cache: hit` or `X-LiteSpeed-Cache: miss` (or any of the alternative headers), then there is a problem with the LSCache configuration.

### Non-Cacheable Pages[¶](#non-cacheable-pages "Permanent link")

Sometimes there are pages which should not be cached. To verify that such pages have indeed been excluded from caching, check the developer tools as described [above](#verify-your-site-is-being-cached).

You should see headings similar to these:

```
X-LiteSpeed-Cache-Control:no-cache, esi=on
X-LiteSpeed-Tag:B1_F,B1_
```

`X-LiteSpeed-Cache-Control`, when set to `no-cache`, indicates that LiteSpeed Server has served your page dynamically, and that it was *intentionally* not served from cache.
