# LiteSpeed Cache for Joomla![¶](#litespeed-cache-for-joomla "Permanent link")

Tip

Joomla 3.x or later is required for this extension

## What is LSCache?[¶](#what-is-lscache "Permanent link")

LiteSpeed Cache, also called LSCache, is LiteSpeed's more efficient and highly customizable answer to Apache `mod_cache` and Varnish.

LSCache is built from the ground up and integrated into all LiteSpeed server products. It can:

- Dramatically speed up dynamic website content, such as PHP pages
- Provide more efficient handling of static content, such as images
- Reduce server load

## Understanding caching[¶](#understanding-caching "Permanent link")

If you are new to website caching, allow us to demystify a few basic concepts.

### What is caching?[¶](#what-is-caching "Permanent link")

Generally speaking, a cache is a mechanism for storing data in such a way that it is easier or faster to retrieve than the original source.

Web applications consist of dynamic pages that are built with PHP or some other method. The pages of these sites don’t exist anywhere in the file system; they are constructed on demand by the web app and then served to the visitor as HTML. Generating these dynamic pages can be resource-intensive and slow.

There are actually several types of caches. LSCache is a "page cache." A page cache's job is to take this dynamically generated web page and store it as a static HTML snapshot. That way, the next time the page is requested by a visitor, the snapshot can be served immediately. Serving a snapshot is much faster and uses far fewer resources than generating the page dynamically does.

### How does LSCache work?[¶](#how-does-lscache-work "Permanent link")

Imagine you have an uncached page.

A visitor requests that page, and a few things happen:

1. LiteSpeed looks for the page among its stored cache objects and does not find it.
2. LiteSpeed returns a "cache miss."
3. The web app dynamically generates a static HTML page while the visitor waits.
4. LiteSpeed serves the static HTML page to the visitor.
5. LiteSpeed stores the static HTML page as a cache object for later use.

A few minutes later, another visitor requests that same page. Here's what happens:

1. LiteSpeed looks for the page among its stored cache objects and finds it.
2. LiteSpeed returns a "cache hit."
3. LiteSpeed immediately serves the static HTML page to the visitor.

Notice how the web app does not need to regenerate the page once the page has been cached? From this point on, until the cache object expires, any visitors who request that page will not have to wait for the web app.

You can see why caching is good for your visitors and good for your server load!

## Why use a plugin?[¶](#why-use-a-plugin "Permanent link")

The LiteSpeed Cache Engine can be controlled through rewrite rules in the `.htaccess` file of a web app's document root. So what do you gain by using an LSCache plugin?

An LSCache plugin bridges the knowledge gap between a web app and the Cache Engine.

Put another way: web apps have rules about what content may be cached, for how long it may be cached, and what events would cause a cache object to become stale. LSCache plugins are a way of communicating these web app rules to the Cache Engine. LSCache plugins allow you to manage the cache in such a way that more objects may be stored for longer periods and managed with unparalleled accuracy.

## VirtueMart support[¶](#virtuemart-support "Permanent link")

Since the **VirtueMart** eCommerce component is a Joomla component, LiteSpeed's LSCache plugin for Joomla supports VirtueMart by default and there is no extra plugin required.

## Server-level prerequisites[¶](#server-level-prerequisites "Permanent link")

### Obtain a LiteSpeed web server[¶](#obtain-a-litespeed-web-server "Permanent link")

To use LSCache, you need either [LiteSpeed-powered hosting](https://www.litespeedtech.com/partners/hosting-providers) or one of the following LiteSpeed server products:

- LiteSpeed Web Server Enterprise:
  - [Order a new license with caching enabled](https://store.litespeedtech.com/store/cart.php)
  - [Add caching to an existing license](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/licenses/how-to/#add-cache-to-an-existing-license)
- [LiteSpeed Web ADC](https://store.litespeedtech.com/store/cart.php)
- [OpenLiteSpeed](https://openlitespeed.org/#install)

Tip

OpenLiteSpeed does not support ESI. If you wish to use ESI, you will need a commercial LiteSpeed product such as LiteSpeed Web Server.

### Configure cache root[¶](#configure-cache-root "Permanent link")

LSCache must be set up at the server level before it can be made available to any sites on the server.

Tip

If you are a site owner and you don't have access to your server's admin functions, your hosting provider has likely already completed this setup for you or can help you complete it.

See [Configure Cache Root and Cache Policy](lscache__start.md#configure-cache-root-and-cache-policy) for instructions.

## Install, configure, and use the plugin[¶](#install-configure-and-use-the-plugin "Permanent link")

Once you've set up your web server and configured the cache root and cache policies, you're ready to install the plugin. The plugin will allow you to configure and manage your LiteSpeed server's cache easily through your site's own familiar admin interface.

Start with [Installation](lscache__lscwp__installation.md), and follow the documentation menu to configure and use the plugin.
