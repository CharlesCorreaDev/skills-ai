# Cache Management CLI[¶](#cache-management-cli "Permanent link")

Our `lscmctl` CLI script provides command-line access to many of the options available through our [WHM plugin for cPanel](lsws__cp__cpanel__whm-litespeed-plugin__wp-cache-management.md#whm-cache-management).

The command-line interface script is located at `/usr/local/lsws/admin/misc/lscmctl` and is used to execute basic cache-management actions through the terminal or in a cron job. You may also recommend a plugin or broadcast a message to all discovered WordPress installations through the CLI tool.

Syntax:

```
./lscmctl [-php path/to/php] <command> [parameters]
```

## setcacheroot[¶](#setcacheroot "Permanent link")

```
./lscmctl setcacheroot [-svr <cache root>] [-vh <cache root>]
```

List or set server or virtual host cache root. This command will list the current server and virtual host cache roots when no additional input is given.

| Flag or Parameter | Description |

Use `-svr` and `-vh` to set those cache roots. The `$` character is not allowed when setting virtual host cache root. Virtual host cache root values starting with a `/` will automatically have `/$vh_user` appended to the end (this format was chosen to maintain compatibility with CageFS).

Examples

List server and virtual host cache roots:

```
./lscmctl setcacheroot
```

```
./lscmctl setcacheroot -vh /path/to/ssd/lscache

Tip

This command may only be used in a cPanel/WHM environment.

Install or uninstall the LiteSpeed user-end plugin for cPanel for all cPanel accounts. The plugin will appear as **LiteSpeed Web Cache Manager** under **Advanced** in the user's cPanel dashboard.

Use `-autoinstall {0 | 1}` to manually turn this off and on respectively. The `--fixConf` input parameter can be used to re-populate the cPanel plugin's configuration file values in case of an issue.

Examples

Install the LiteSpeed user-end plugin for cPanel for all cPanel accounts:

```
./lscmctl cpanelplugin --install

A single installation can be added using the `-wpinstall` parameter a space-separated list of installation info in the required order (`<wp path> <docroot> <server name> <site url>`). Multiple installations can be added at once using the `-wpinstallsfile` parameter to provide the path to an installs file containing a newline-separated list of installation info in the expected format.

Examples

Add a single WordPress Installations to custom data file.: `./lscmctl addinstalls -wpinstall /home/user/public_html/wp /home/user/public_html example.com example.com/wp`

Add multiple WordPress Installations to custom data file using an installs file.: `./lscmctl addinstalls -wpinstallsfile /path/to/installs/file`

## --update-lib[¶](#-update-lib "Permanent link")

```
./lscmctl --update-lib
```

```

Force update the `lscmctl` script and the required shared library to their latest versions. It is not recommended that this command be included in any cron jobs. Use the `--update-lib` command instead.

## Scan And Enable Using A CronJob[¶](#scan-and-enable-using-a-cronjob "Permanent link")

If you do not want to continue manually running the CLI script you can set up a cronjob to run the script at fixed intervals instead.

First, as root, open crontab cronjobs with following command:

```
crontab -e
```

After that, you can add a CLI command in [the usual cronjob format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Overview), similar to the following examples.

Examples

At 3:00am, perform a full re-scan and enable LSCWP for all discovered installations:

```
00 03 * * * /usr/local/lsws/admin/misc/lscmctl scan -e
```

At 3:00am, scan only for new installations and enable LSCWP for all known installations:

```
00 03 * * * /usr/local/lsws/admin/misc/lscmctl scan -n -e
```

At 3:00am, scan only for new installations and enable LSCWP only for those newly discovered installations (this is a recommended usage): ``` 00 03 \* \* \* /usr/local/lsws/admin/misc/lscmctl scannew -en
