## Introduction[¶](#introduction "Permanent link")

LiteSpeed Web Server (LSWS) is a high-performance, secure, and easy-to-use web server that can be used as a drop-in replacement for an Apache web server. It can handle thousands of concurrent connections with a small memory footprint and thwart incoming attacks with ease.

- Installation: 200 MB
- Runtime: 300 MB or more. The amount of swap space required depends on usage.

Note

RAM-limited LSWS licenses are not recommended when using an LXC container (including Proxmox). LiteSpeed uses `sysinfo()` to detect memory size. As a result, you may hit the RAM limit when using an LXC container because it returns the *host* memory size.

Licenses with unlimited RAM do not have this problem.

## WebAdmin Console[¶](#webadmin-console "Permanent link")

LiteSpeed Web Server includes WebAdmin Console, a centralized control panel for managing and configuring web server settings. See the [WebAdmin documentation](https://www.litespeedtech.com/docs/webserver/admin) to learn more.
