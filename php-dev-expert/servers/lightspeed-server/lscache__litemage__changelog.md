## Version 2.2.7[¶](#version-227 "Permanent link")

*Released: July 10, 2026*

- [Improvement] Changed the default **Purge Products after a Sale** behavior to **Always purge the product** for safer cache invalidation on fresh installs.
- [Improvement] Removed the hard dependency on `magento/module-inventory-sales-api/Magento_InventorySalesApi`; Magento Inventory stock services are now resolved only when needed.
- [Bug fix] Fixed checkout/order-placement crashes when Magento Inventory (MSI) modules or stock services are disabled or unavailable.
- [Bug fix] Clarified the admin configuration error when **Only purge the product when out of stock** is selected without `magento/module-inventory-sales`.

## Version 2.2.6[¶](#version-226 "Permanent link")

*Released: May 26, 2026*

- [Security] Stopped trusting client-forwarded LiteMage and debug headers for runtime module enablement and debug IP matching.

- [Improvement] Modernized frontend and shell controllers for current Magento action interfaces and raw result responses.
- [Improvement] Switched CLI purge requests to Magento's framework Curl client with signed URLs, explicit batch flushing, host-header support, basic-auth handling, and improved response logging.
- [Improvement] Returned explicit success codes from LiteMage CLI commands for Magento 2.4.6+ console compatibility. (Thanks @martinstoehr.)
- [Improvement] Split LiteMage tag headers by value length so large identity-tag sets are emitted across multiple headers instead of being truncated.
- [Improvement] Switched custom vary refresh to a GET JSON endpoint with `no-store` response headers.
- [Improvement] Marked generated ESI includes as `no-vary` and skipped custom-vary refresh checks for ESI requests.
- [Improvement] Improved admin LiteMage statistics parsing and output escaping.
- [Improvement] Preserved required customer-login and customer-group vary context from bypass configuration.
- [Bug fix] Corrected after-order product purge selection for parent and child product cases.
