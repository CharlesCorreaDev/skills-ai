## 500 Error During Installation[¶](#500-error-during-installation "Permanent link")

You may experience a 500 error during installation if:

- The PHP version is less than 7.1
- PHP module packages are missing

Check your PHP version. If it's lower than PHP 7.1, you will need to upgrade to a newer version.

If you are using acceptable version of PHP, then the problem may be missing PHP modules. Check the server error log. You may see something like the following:

```
    [STDERR] Error: Class 'ZipArchive' not found in /var/www/html/core/lib/Drupal/Core/Archiver/Zip.php on line 30 #0 /var/www/html/core/lib/Drupal/Core/Archiver/ArchiverManager.php(42): Drupal\Core\Archiver\Zip->__construct('/tmp/lscache-dr...')
```

Install the specified package (`php-pecl-zip` in this example), and that should fix the problem.
