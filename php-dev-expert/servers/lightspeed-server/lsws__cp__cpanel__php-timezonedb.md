# TimeZoneDB[¶](#timezonedb "Permanent link")

This guide will address how and why we need to build TimeZoneDB for EasyApache 4.

## What is TimeZoneDB?[¶](#what-is-timezonedb "Permanent link")

TimeZoneDB.so is a PHP PECL extension that supplies a database of all timezones from [the Olson database](http://www.iana.org/time-zones) for all PHP date and time functions.

## The Issue[¶](#the-issue "Permanent link")

Recent patches to EasyApache 4 have removed a lot of standard PECL extensions and added them to their web utility to install. The issue with that is that it scans the whole system for PHP and builds it for each version it finds, even non-EA4 PHP. This causes high resource usage, which in most cases is a bad thing. This script that we provide will only build it for EA4 with predefined searches. This essentially cuts usage down and provides a more stable environment.
