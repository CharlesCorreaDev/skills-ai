## Version 1.4[¶](#version-14 "Permanent link")

*Released: August 4, 2006*

- [Feature] Limit the maximum number of worker processes to twice the configured value to prevent DoS-type attacks.
- [Feature] Add the `LSAPI_MAX_REQS=n` environment variable, where `n` is the maximum number of requests a child process can serve. The default value is `1,000`. Once the limit is reached, the child process exits automatically. This helps address memory leaks in Rails.
- [Feature] Add the `LSAPI_MAX_IDLE=n` environment variable, where `n` is the maximum idle time, in seconds, that a child process waits for a new request. Once the limit is reached, the child process exits. The default value is 60. When `n <= 0`, the child process waits indefinitely. This option helps eliminate idle child processes.
- [Bug fix] Fix an issue where a worker process did not remain persistent when a request was canceled.

## Version 1.3[¶](#version-13 "Permanent link")

*Released: June 29, 2006*
