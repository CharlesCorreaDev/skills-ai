Note

We do our best to update this changelog in a timely manner. However, if a version is missing, you can always find the release announcement in [our LiteSpeed Edge Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/litespeed-edge-users).

## WHM Plugin v5.3.6.0[¶](#whm-plugin-v5360 "Permanent link")

*Released: September 21, 2026*

Bundled with [cPanel User-End Plugin v2.4.10.0](#cpanel-user-end-plugin-v24100).

- [Improvement] Add support for cPanel’s new Meridian theme, introduced in cPanel v138. The user-end plugin icon does not yet appear for Meridian accounts because of a cPanel limitation affecting all third-party plugins. The icon should appear if cPanel adds support.
- [Improvement] Report LiteSpeed installation warnings in separate messages so they are easier to notice.
- [Improvement] Significantly sped up Redis package processing.
- [Bug fix] Fix LiteSpeed installation setting an unusable WebAdmin password, which could lock the administrator out of the WebAdmin Console.
- [Bug fix] Fix EasyApache PHP `timezonedb` updates reporting verification failures for every PHP version on servers whose `php.ini` enabled output compression.
- [Bug fix] Fix Redis maintenance applying the wrong memory size or skipping an account for certain package and user names.
- [Bug fix] Fix Redis maintenance acting on an empty username on servers with no per-user Redis services.
- [Bug fix] Skipped Redis package synchronization when no package had Redis configured.
- [Bug fix] Fix Redis failing to enable through the cPanel user plugin on LiteSpeed Containers servers with a leftover `~/.cagefs` directory.
- [Bug fix] Prevent a hang or long delay in `validate_redis.sh` plugin processing when no JSON data was available.
- [Bug fix] Reject trailing newlines in custom cPanel plugin template names and WebAdmin login ID input checks.

## cPanel User-End Plugin v2.4.10.0[¶](#cpanel-user-end-plugin-v24100 "Permanent link")

*Released: September 21, 2026*

Bundled with [WHM Plugin v5.3.6.0](#whm-plugin-v5360).

- [Improvement] Add support for cPanel’s new Meridian theme, introduced in cPanel v138. The plugin icon does not yet appear for Meridian accounts because of a cPanel limitation affecting all third-party plugins. The icon should appear if cPanel adds support.
- [Bug fix] Fix a regression in cPanel LiteSpeed Namespaces detection.

## WHM Plugin v5.3.5.0[¶](#whm-plugin-v5350 "Permanent link")

*Released: August 4, 2026*

Bundled with [cPanel User-End Plugin v2.4.9.1](#cpanel-user-end-plugin-v2491).

- [Improvement] Report clearer EasyApache PHP `timezonedb` results, including a per-PHP-version outcome and an actionable error naming any missing build prerequisite.
- [Improvement] Validate the LiteSpeed home directory more strictly wherever it is used.
- [Bug fix] Fix several EasyApache PHP `timezonedb` update failures, including builds on servers using cPanel secure `tmp`, the CageFS update immediately following a successful build, and `lsphp` not being restarted on servers with a non-default LiteSpeed home directory.
- [Bug fix] Fix a custom LiteSpeed home directory being saved but then ignored, so the plugin, EasyApache hooks, and `timezonedb` updates could each use a different directory.
- [Bug fix] Fix the plugin deleting its saved LiteSpeed home directory setting when the file contained a comment or extra line, which made EasyApache hooks report LiteSpeed as not installed and stop running. The setting is now kept and the problem reported instead.
- [Bug fix] Fix web server status detection reporting Apache or LiteSpeed as running after it had stopped, or reporting both as running on a LiteSpeed-only server.
- [Bug fix] Fix switching web servers stopping unrelated processes, leaving part of the previous server running, holding ports needed by the server being started, and briefly interrupting PHP for sites.
- [Bug fix] Fix LiteSpeed installation failing partway through on servers whose `php.ini` omits "E" from `variables_order`.
- [Bug fix] Fix a LiteSpeed installation that fails to start being reported as a license error on the License Status and Transfer License screens.

## cPanel User-End Plugin v2.4.9.1[¶](#cpanel-user-end-plugin-v2491 "Permanent link")

*Released: July 28, 2026*

Bundled with [cPanel User-End Plugin v2.4.9](#cpanel-user-end-plugin-v249).

- [Bug fix] Fix EasyApache PHP `timezonedb` updates failing to detect, build, and enable the extension in the correct `php.ini`.
- [Bug fix] Only enable and restart `lsphp` once a working `timezonedb.so` is verified, so a failed or stale update can no longer crash PHP workers (503s).
