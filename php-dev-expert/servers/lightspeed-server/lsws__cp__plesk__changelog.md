Note

We do our best to update this changelog in a timely manner. However, if a version is missing, you can always find the release announcement in [our LiteSpeed Edge Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/litespeed-edge-users).

- [Bug fix] Fix LiteSpeed Containers restarting PHP for every user whenever Plesk installs or updates a component, renews a certificate, or changes a subscription. Gracefully restart PHP only for affected users.
