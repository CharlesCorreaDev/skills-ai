## Module ngx\_http\_userid\_module

|  |
| --- |
| [Example Configuration](#example) [Directives](#directives)      [userid](#userid)      [userid\_domain](#userid_domain)      [userid\_expires](#userid_expires)      [userid\_flags](#userid_flags)      [userid\_mark](#userid_mark)      [userid\_name](#userid_name)      [userid\_p3p](#userid_p3p)      [userid\_path](#userid_path)      [userid\_service](#userid_service) [Embedded Variables](#variables) |

The `ngx_http_userid_module` module sets cookies
suitable for client identification.
Received and set cookies can be logged using the embedded variables
[$uid\_got](#var_uid_got) and
[$uid\_set](#var_uid_set).
This module is compatible with the
[mod\_uid](http://www.lexa.ru/programs/mod-uid-eng.html)
module for Apache.

#### Example Configuration

> ```
> userid         on;
> userid_name    uid;
> userid_domain  example.com;
> userid_path    /;
> userid_expires 365d;
> userid_p3p     'policyref="/w3c/p3p.xml", CP="CUR ADM OUR NOR STA NID"';
> ```

#### Directives

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Syntax: | `userid on | v1 | log | off;` |
| Default: | ``` userid off; ``` |
| Context: | `http`, `server`, `location` |

Enables or disables setting cookies and logging the received cookies:

`on`
:   enables the setting of version 2 cookies
    and logging of the received cookies;

`v1`
:   enables the setting of version 1 cookies
    and logging of the received cookies;

`log`
:   disables the setting of cookies,
    but enables logging of the received cookies;

`off`
:   disables the setting of cookies and logging of the received cookies.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Syntax: | `userid_domain name | none;` |
| Default: | ``` userid_domain none; ``` |
| Context: | `http`, `server`, `location` |

Defines a domain for which the cookie is set.
The `none` parameter disables setting of a domain for the
cookie.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Syntax: | `userid_expires time | max | off;` |
| Default: | ``` userid_expires off; ``` |
| Context: | `http`, `server`, `location` |

Sets a time during which a browser should keep the cookie.
The parameter `max` will cause the cookie to expire on
“`31 Dec 2037 23:55:55 GMT`”.
The parameter `off` will cause the cookie to expire at
the end of a browser session.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Syntax: | `userid_flags off | flag ...;` |
| Default: | ``` userid_flags off; ``` |
| Context: | `http`, `server`, `location` |

This directive appeared in version 1.19.3.

If the parameter is not `off`,
defines one or more additional flags for the cookie:
`secure`,
`httponly`,
`samesite=strict`,
`samesite=lax`,
`samesite=none`.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Syntax: | `userid_mark letter | digit | = | off;` |
| Default: | ``` userid_mark off; ``` |
| Context: | `http`, `server`, `location` |

If the parameter is not `off`, enables the cookie marking
mechanism and sets the character used as a mark.
This mechanism is used to add or change
[userid\_p3p](#userid_p3p) and/or a cookie expiration time while
preserving the client identifier.
A mark can be any letter of the English alphabet (case-sensitive),
digit, or the “`=`” character.

If the mark is set, it is compared with the first padding symbol
in the base64 representation of the client identifier passed in a cookie.
If they do not match, the cookie is resent with the specified mark,
expiration time, and “P3P” header.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Syntax: | `userid_name name;` |
| Default: | ``` userid_name uid; ``` |
| Context: | `http`, `server`, `location` |

Sets the cookie name.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Syntax: | `userid_p3p string | none;` |
| Default: | ``` userid_p3p none; ``` |
| Context: | `http`, `server`, `location` |

Sets a value for the “P3P” header field that will be
sent along with the cookie.
If the directive is set to the special value `none`,
the “P3P” header will not be sent in a response.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Syntax: | `userid_path path;` |
| Default: | ``` userid_path /; ``` |
| Context: | `http`, `server`, `location` |

Defines a path for which the cookie is set.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Syntax: | `userid_service number;` |
| Default: | ``` userid_service IP address of the server; ``` |
| Context: | `http`, `server`, `location` |

If identifiers are issued by multiple servers (services),
each service should be assigned its own `number`
to ensure that client identifiers are unique.
For version 1 cookies, the default value is zero.
For version 2 cookies, the default value is the number composed from the last
four octets of the server’s IP address.

#### Embedded Variables

The `ngx_http_userid_module` module
supports the following embedded variables:

`$uid_got`
:   The cookie name and received client identifier.

`$uid_reset`
:   If the variable is set to a non-empty string that is not “`0`”,
    the client identifiers are reset.
    The special value “`log`” additionally leads to the output of
    messages about the reset identifiers to the
    [error\_log](ngx_core_module.md#error_log).

`$uid_set`
:   The cookie name and sent client identifier.
