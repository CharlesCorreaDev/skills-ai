## Security

All nginx security issues should be reported
via one of the methods listed
[here](https://github.com/nginx/njs/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

Patches are signed using one of the
[PGP public keys](https://nginx.org/en/pgp_keys.html).

#### Special considerations

njs does not evaluate dynamic code,
especially code received from the network, in any way.
The only way to evaluate that code using njs
is to configure the
[js\_import](http__ngx_http_js_module.md#js_import)
directive in nginx.
JavaScript code is loaded once during nginx start.

In the nginx/njs threat model, JavaScript code is considered a trusted source
in the same way as `nginx.conf` and sites certificates.
What this means in practice:

- memory disclosure and other security issues
  triggered by JavaScript code modification
  are not considered security vulnerabilities, but rather ordinary bugs
- measures should be taken for protecting JavaScript code used by njs
- if no [js\_import](http__ngx_http_js_module.md#js_import)
  directives are present in `nginx.conf`,
  nginx is safe from JavaScript-related vulnerabilities
