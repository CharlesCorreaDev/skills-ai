# Caddyfile Directives

Directives are functional keywords that appear within site [blocks](caddyfile__concepts.md#blocks). Sometimes, they may open blocks of their own which can contain *subdirectives*, but directives **cannot** be used within other directives unless noted. For example, you can't use `basic_auth` inside a `file_server` block, because `file_server` does not know how to do authentication. However, you *may* use some directives within special directive blocks like `handle` and `route` because they are specifically designed to group HTTP handler directives.

The following directives come standard with Caddy, and can be used in the HTTP Caddyfile:

## Syntax

The syntax of each directive will look something like this:

```
directive [<matcher>] <args...> {
	subdirective [<args...>]
}
```

The `<carets>` indicate tokens to be substituted by actual values.

The`[brackets]` indicate optional parameters.

The ellipses `...` indicates a continuation, i.e. one or more parameters or lines.

Subdirectives are typically optional unless documented otherwise, even though they don't appear in `[brackets]`.

### Matchers

Most—but not all—directives accept [matcher tokens](caddyfile__matchers.md#syntax), which let you filter requests. Matcher tokens are usually optional. Directives support matchers if you see this in a directive's syntax:

```
[<matcher>]
```

Because matcher tokens all work the same, the various possibilities for the matcher token will not be described on every page, to reduce duplication. Instead, refer to the [matcher documentation](caddyfile__matchers.md) for a detailed explanation of the syntax.

## Directive order

Many directives manipulate the HTTP handler chain. The order in which those directives are evaluated matters, so a default ordering is hard-coded into Caddy.

You can override/customize this ordering by using the [`order` global option](caddyfile__options.md#order) or the [`route` directive](caddyfile__directives__route.md).

```
tracing

map
vars
fs
root
log_append
log_skip
log_name

header
copy_response_headers # only in reverse_proxy's handle_response block

# incoming request manipulation

# middleware handlers; some wrap responses
basic_auth
forward_auth
request_header

# special routing & dispatching directives

# handlers that typically respond to requests
abort
error
copy_response # only in reverse_proxy's handle_response block
respond

acme_server
```

## Sorting algorithm

For ease of use, the Caddyfile adapter sorts directives according to the following rules:

- Differently named directives are sorted by their position in the [default order](#directive-order). The default order can be overridden with the [`order` global option](caddyfile__options.md). Directives from plugins *do not* have an order, so the [`order`](caddyfile__options.md) global option or the [`route`](caddyfile__directives__route.md) directive should be used to set one.
- Same-named directives are sorted according to their [matchers](caddyfile__matchers.md#syntax).

  - A directive with a single [path matcher](caddyfile__matchers.md#path-matchers) value, such as `/foo*`, is sorted by specificity relative to other directives with a single path, from most specific to least specific. This also applies to a [named matcher](caddyfile__matchers.md#named-matchers) with a `path` matcher that has only one path.

    In general, this is performed by sorting by the length of the path, ignoring a trailing `*`. If the paths of the two matchers are otherwise the same, the matcher with no `*` is considered more specific and sorted higher. Paths of the same length are sorted alphabetically.

    For example:

    - `/foobar` is more specific than `/foo`
    - `/foo` is more specific than `/foo*`
    - `/foo/*` is more specific than `/foo*`
  - A directive with any other matcher, such as a named matcher or a path matcher with multiple values, keeps the order it appears in the Caddyfile. Directives with a single path are *not* sorted past it, so they are only sorted among the other single-path directives next to them.

    For example, these directives are not reordered at all, because the `@api` named matcher separates them:

    ```
    respond /a*  "1"
    respond @api "2"
    respond /a/b "3"
    respond /a   "4"
    ```
  - A directive with no matcher (i.e. matching all requests) is sorted last.

  If the sorted order is not what you need, use the [`route`](caddyfile__directives__route.md) directive to set the order explicitly, or mutually exclusive [`handle`](caddyfile__directives__handle.md) blocks.
- The [`vars`](caddyfile__directives__vars.md) directive has its ordering by matcher reversed, because it involves setting values which can overwrite each other, so the most specific matcher should be evaluated last.
- The contents of the [`route`](caddyfile__directives__route.md) directive ignores all the above rules, and preserves the order the directives appear within.
