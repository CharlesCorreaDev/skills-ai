# Response

[Edit This Page](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim-Website/tree/gh-pages/docs/v4/objects/response.md)

Your Slim app’s routes and middleware are given a PSR-7 response object that represents the current HTTP response to be returned to the client.
The response object implements the [PSR-7 ResponseInterface](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/#33-psrhttpmessageresponseinterface) with which you can inspect and manipulate the HTTP response status, headers, and body.

## How to get the Response object

The PSR-7 response object is injected into your Slim application routes as the second argument to the route callback like this:

```
<?php

use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;
use Slim\Factory\AppFactory;

require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$app = AppFactory::create();

$app->get('/hello', function (Request $request, Response $response) {
    $response->getBody()->write('Hello World');
    return $response;
});

$app->run();
```

Figure 1: Inject PSR-7 response into application route callback.

## The Response Status

Every HTTP response has a numeric [status code](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).
The status code identifies the *type* of HTTP response to be returned to the client.
The PSR-7 Response object’s default status code is `200` (OK).
You can get the PSR-7 Response object’s status code with the `getStatusCode()` method like this.

```
$status = $response->getStatusCode();
```

Figure 3: Get response status code.

You can copy a PSR-7 Response object and assign a new status code like this:

```
$newResponse = $response->withStatus(302);
```

Figure 4: Create response with new status code.

## The Response Headers

Every HTTP response has headers.
These are metadata that describe the HTTP response but are not visible in the response’s body. The PSR-7 Response object provides several methods to inspect and manipulate its headers.

### Get All Headers

You can fetch all HTTP response headers as an associative array with the PSR-7 Response object’s `getHeaders()` method.
The resultant associative array’s keys are the header names and its values are themselves a numeric array of string values for their respective header name.

```
$headers = $response->getHeaders();
foreach ($headers as $name => $values) {
    echo $name . ": " . implode(", ", $values);
}
```

Figure 5: Fetch and iterate all HTTP response headers as an associative array.

### Get One Header

You can get a single header’s value(s) with the PSR-7 Response object’s `getHeader($name)` method.
This returns an array of values for the given header name.
Remember, *a single HTTP header may have more than one value!*

```
$headerValueArray = $response->getHeader('Vary');
```

Figure 6: Get values for a specific HTTP header.

You may also fetch a comma-separated string with all values for a given header with the PSR-7 Response object’s `getHeaderLine($name)` method.
Unlike the `getHeader($name)` method, this method returns a comma-separated string.

```
$headerValueString = $response->getHeaderLine('Vary');
```

Figure 7: Get single header's values as comma-separated string.

### Detect Header

You can test for the presence of a header with the PSR-7 Response object’s `hasHeader($name)` method.

```
if ($response->hasHeader('Vary')) {
    // Do something
}
```

Figure 8: Detect presence of a specific HTTP header.

### Set Header

You can set a header value with the PSR-7 Response object’s `withHeader($name, $value)` method.

```
$newResponse = $oldResponse->withHeader('Content-type', 'application/json');
```

Figure 9: Set HTTP header

**Reminder**

The Response object is immutable. This method returns a *copy* of
the Response object that has the new header value. **This method is
destructive**, and it *replaces* existing header
values already associated with the same header name.

### Append Header

You can append a header value with the PSR-7 Response object’s
`withAddedHeader($name, $value)` method.

```
$newResponse = $oldResponse->withAddedHeader('Allow', 'PUT');
```

Figure 10: Append HTTP header

**Reminder**

Unlike the `withHeader()` method, this method *appends*
the new value to the set of values that already exist for the same header
name. The Response object is immutable. This method returns a
*copy* of the Response object that has the appended header value.

### Remove Header

You can remove a header with the Response object’s `withoutHeader($name)` method.

```
$newResponse = $oldResponse->withoutHeader('Allow');
```

Figure 11: Remove HTTP header

**Reminder**

The Response object is immutable. This method returns a *copy*
of the Response object without the specified header.

## The Response Body

An HTTP response typically has a body.

Just like the PSR-7 Request object, the PSR-7 Response object implements the body as an instance of `Psr\Http\Message\StreamInterface`.
You can get the HTTP response body `StreamInterface` instance with the PSR-7 Response object’s `getBody()` method.
The `getBody()` method is preferable if the outgoing HTTP response length is unknown or too large for available memory.

```
$body = $response->getBody();
```

Figure 12: Get HTTP response body

The resultant `Psr\Http\Message\StreamInterface` instance provides the following methods to read from, iterate, and write to its underlying PHP `resource`.

- getSize()
- tell()
- eof()
- isSeekable()
- seek()
- rewind()
- isWritable()
- write($string)
- isReadable()
- read($length)
- getContents()
- getMetadata($key = null)

Most often, you’ll need to write to the PSR-7 Response object.
You can write content to the `StreamInterface` instance with its `write()` method like this:

```
$body = $response->getBody();
$body->write('Hello');
```

Figure 13: Write content to the HTTP response body

You can also *replace* the PSR-7 Response object’s body with an entirely new `StreamInterface` instance.
This is particularly useful when you want to pipe content from a remote destination (e.g. the filesystem or a remote API) into the HTTP response.
You can replace the PSR-7 Response object’s body with its `withBody(StreamInterface $body)` method.
Its argument **MUST** be an instance of `Psr\Http\Message\StreamInterface`.

```
use GuzzleHttp\Psr7\LazyOpenStream;

$newStream = new LazyOpenStream('/path/to/file', 'r');
$newResponse = $oldResponse->withBody($newStream);
```

Figure 14: Replace the HTTP response body

**Reminder**

The Response object is immutable. This method returns a *copy*
of the Response object that contains the new body.

## Returning JSON

In it’s simplest form, JSON data can be returned with a default 200 HTTP status code.

```
$data = array('name' => 'Bob', 'age' => 40);
$payload = json_encode($data);

$response->getBody()->write($payload);
return $response
          ->withHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
```

Figure 15: Returning JSON with a 200 HTTP status code.

We can also return JSON data with a custom HTTP status code.

```
$data = array('name' => 'Rob', 'age' => 40);
$payload = json_encode($data);

$response->getBody()->write($payload);
return $response
          ->withHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json')
          ->withStatus(201);
```

Figure 16: Returning JSON with a 201 HTTP status code.

**Reminder**

The Response object is immutable. This method returns a *copy* of
the Response object that has a new Content-Type header. **This method is destructive**, and it *replaces* the existing Content-Type header.

## Returning a Redirect

You can redirect the HTTP client by using the `Location` header.

```
return $response
  ->withHeader('Location', 'https://www.example.com')
  ->withStatus(302);
```
