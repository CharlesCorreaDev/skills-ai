# Routing Middleware

[Edit This Page](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim-Website/tree/gh-pages/docs/v4/middleware/routing.md)

The routing has been implemented as middleware.
We are still using [FastRoute](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute) as the default router but it is not tightly coupled to it.
If you wanted to implement another routing library you could by creating your own implementations of the routing interfaces.
`DispatcherInterface`, `RouteCollectorInterface`, `RouteParserInterface` and `RouteResolverInterface` create a bridge between Slim’s components and the routing library.
If you were using `determineRouteBeforeAppMiddleware`, you need to add the `Middleware\RoutingMiddleware` middleware to your application just before your call to `run()` to maintain the previous behaviour.

## Usage

```
<?php

use Slim\Factory\AppFactory;

require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$app = AppFactory::create();

// Add Routing Middleware
$app->addRoutingMiddleware();

// ...

$app->run();
```
