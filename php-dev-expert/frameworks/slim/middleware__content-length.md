# Content Length Middleware

[Edit This Page](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim-Website/tree/gh-pages/docs/v4/middleware/content-length.md)

The Content Length Middleware will automatically append a `Content-Length` header to the response.
This is to replace the `addContentLengthHeader` setting that was removed from Slim 3.
This middleware should be placed on the end of the middleware stack so that it gets executed first and exited last.

## Usage

```
<?php

use Slim\Factory\AppFactory;
use Slim\Middleware\ContentLengthMiddleware;

require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$app = AppFactory::create();

// Add any middleware which may modify the response body before adding the ContentLengthMiddleware

$contentLengthMiddleware = new ContentLengthMiddleware();
$app->add($contentLengthMiddleware);

// ...

$app->run();
```
