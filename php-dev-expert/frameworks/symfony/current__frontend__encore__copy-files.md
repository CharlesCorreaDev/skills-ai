# Copying & Referencing Images with Webpack Encore

[Edit this page](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/edit/8.1/frontend/encore/copy-files.rst)

Need to reference a static file - like the path to an image for an `img` tag?
That can be tricky if you store your assets outside of the public document root.
Fortunately, depending on your situation, there is a solution!

## [Referencing Images from Inside a Webpacked JavaScript File](#referencing-images-from-inside-a-webpacked-javascript-file "Permalink to this headline")

To reference an image tag from inside a JavaScript file, *require* the file:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
```

```
// assets/app.js

// returns the final, public path to this file
// path is relative to this file - e.g. assets/images/logo.png
import logoPath from '../images/logo.png';

let html = `<img src="${logoPath}" alt="ACME logo">`;
```

When you `require` (or `import`) an image file, Webpack copies it into your
output directory and returns the final, *public* path to that file.

## [Referencing Image files from a Template](#referencing-image-files-from-a-template "Permalink to this headline")

To reference an image file from outside of a JavaScript file that's processed by
Webpack - like a template - you can use the `copyFiles()` method to copy those
files into your final output directory. First enable it in `webpack.config.js`:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
```

```
// webpack.config.js

  Encore
      // ...
      .setOutputPath('public/build/')

+     .copyFiles({
+         from: './assets/images',
+
+         // optional target path, relative to the output dir
+         to: 'images/[path][name].[ext]',
+
+         // if versioning is enabled, add the file hash too
+         //to: 'images/[path][name].[hash:8].[ext]',
+
+         // only copy files matching this pattern
+         //pattern: /\.(png|jpg|jpeg)$/
+     })
```

Then restart Encore. When you do, it will give you a command you can run to
install any missing dependencies. After running that command and restarting
Encore, you're done!

This will copy all files from `assets/images` into `public/build/images`.
If you have [versioning enabled](current__frontend__encore__versioning.md), the copied files will
include a hash based on their content.

To render inside Twig, use the `asset()` function:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

```
{# assets/images/logo.png was copied to public/build/images/logo.png #}
<img src="{{ asset('build/images/logo.png') }}" alt="ACME logo">

{# assets/images/subdir/logo.png was copied to public/build/images/subdir/logo.png #}
<img src="{{ asset('build/images/subdir/logo.png') }}" alt="ACME logo">
```

Make sure you've enabled the [json\_manifest\_path](current__frontend__encore__versioning.md#load-manifest-files) option,
which tells the `asset()` function to read the final paths from the `manifest.json`
file. If you're not sure what path argument to pass to the `asset()` function,
find the file in `manifest.json` and use the *key* as the argument.
