# AssetMapper: Simple, Modern CSS & JS Management

[Edit this page](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/edit/8.1/frontend/asset_mapper.rst)

The AssetMapper component lets you write modern JavaScript and CSS without the complexity
of using a bundler. Browsers *already* support many modern JavaScript features
like the `import` statement and ES6 classes. And the HTTP/2 protocol means that
combining your assets to reduce HTTP connections is no longer urgent. This component
is a light layer that helps serve your files directly to the browser.

The component has two main features:

- [Mapping & Versioning Assets](current__frontend__asset_mapper.md#mapping-assets): All files inside of `assets/`
  are made available publicly and **versioned**. You can reference the file
  `assets/images/product.jpg` in a Twig template with `{{ asset('images/product.jpg') }}`.
  The final URL will include a version hash, like `/assets/images/product-3c16d92m.jpg`.
- [Importmaps](current__frontend__asset_mapper.md#importmaps-javascript): A native browser feature that makes it easier
  to use the JavaScript `import` statement (e.g. `import { Modal } from 'bootstrap'`)
  without a build system. It's widely supported in all browsers (a polyfill covers the rare
  exceptions) as it's part of the [HTML standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#import-maps).

## [Installation](#installation "Permalink to this headline")

To install the AssetMapper component, run:

```
1
```

```
$ composer require symfony/asset-mapper symfony/asset symfony/twig-pack
```

In addition to `symfony/asset-mapper`, this also makes sure that you have the
[Asset Component](current__components__asset.md) and Twig available.

If you're using [Symfony Flex](current__setup.md#symfony-flex), you're done! The recipe just
added a number of files:

- `assets/app.js` Your main JavaScript file;
- `assets/styles/app.css` Your main CSS file;
- `config/packages/asset_mapper.yaml` Where you define your asset "paths";
- `importmap.php` Your importmap config file.

It also *updated* the `templates/base.html.twig` file:

```
1
2
3
```

```
{% block javascripts %}
+    {% block importmap %}{{ importmap('app') }}{% endblock %}
{% endblock %}
```

If you're not using Flex, you'll need to create & update these files manually. See
the [latest asset-mapper recipe](https://github.com/symfony/recipes/tree/main/symfony/asset-mapper) for the exact content of these files.

## [Mapping and Referencing Assets](#mapping-and-referencing-assets "Permalink to this headline")

The AssetMapper component works by defining directories/paths of assets that you want to expose
publicly. These assets are then versioned and easy to reference. Thanks to the
`asset_mapper.yaml` file, your app starts with one mapped path: the `assets/`
directory.

If you create an `assets/images/duck.png` file, you can reference it in a template with:

```
1
```

```
<img src="{{ asset('images/duck.png') }}">
```

The path - `images/duck.png` - is relative to your mapped directory (`assets/`).
This is known as the **logical path** to your asset.

If you look at the HTML in your page, the URL will be something
like: `/assets/images/duck-3c16d92m.png`. If you change
the file, the version part of the URL will also change automatically.

### [Serving Assets in dev vs prod](#serving-assets-in-dev-vs-prod "Permalink to this headline")

In the `dev` environment, the URL `/assets/images/duck-3c16d92m.png`
is handled and returned by your Symfony app. For the `prod` environment,
before deploy, you'll run a command to write the final versioned files into
`public/assets/` so that they're served directly by your web server. See
[Compiling Assets](current__frontend__asset_mapper.md#asset-mapper-compile-assets) for more details.

### [Debugging: Seeing All Mapped Assets](#debugging-seeing-all-mapped-assets "Permalink to this headline")

To see all of the mapped assets in your app, run:

```
1
```

```
$ php bin/console debug:asset-map
```

This will show you all the mapped paths and the assets inside of each:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
```

```
AssetMapper Paths
------------------

--------- ------------------
 Path      Namespace prefix
--------- ------------------
assets

Mapped Assets
-------------

------------------ ----------------------------------------------------
 Logical Path       Filesystem Path
------------------ ----------------------------------------------------
 app.js             assets/app.js
 styles/app.css     assets/styles/app.css
 images/duck.png    assets/images/duck.png
```

The "Logical Path" is the path to use when referencing the asset, like
from a template.

The `debug:asset-map` command provides several options to filter results:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
```

```
# provide an asset name or dir to only show results that match it
$ php bin/console debug:asset-map bootstrap.js
$ php bin/console debug:asset-map style/

# provide an extension to only show that file type
$ php bin/console debug:asset-map --ext=css

# you can also only show assets in vendor/ dir or exclude any results from it
$ php bin/console debug:asset-map --vendor
$ php bin/console debug:asset-map --no-vendor

# you can also combine all filters (e.g. find bold web fonts in your own asset dirs)
$ php bin/console debug:asset-map bold --no-vendor --ext=woff2
```

## [Importmaps & Writing JavaScript](#importmaps-writing-javascript "Permalink to this headline")

All modern browsers support the JavaScript [import statement](https://caniuse.com/es6-module-dynamic-import) and modern
[ES6](https://caniuse.com/es6) features like classes. So this code "just works":

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

```
// assets/app.js
import Duck from './duck.js';

const duck = new Duck('Waddles');
duck.quack();
```

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

```
// assets/duck.js
export default class {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    quack() {
        console.log(`${this.name} says: Quack!`);
    }
}
```

Thanks to the `{{ importmap('app') }}` Twig function call, which you'll learn about in
this section, the `assets/app.js` file is loaded & executed by the browser.

Tip

When importing relative files, be sure to include the `.js` filename extension.
Unlike in Node.js, this extension is required in the browser environment.

### [How does the importmap Work?](#how-does-the-importmap-work "Permalink to this headline")

All of this works thanks to the `{{ importmap() }}` Twig function in
`base.html.twig`, which outputs an [importmap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap) (shown here with a
third-party `bootstrap` package, which you'll learn to
[add later in this article](current__frontend__asset_mapper.md#importmaps-thirdparty)):

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
```

```
<script type="importmap">{
    "imports": {
        "app": "/assets/app-4e986c1a.js",
        "/assets/duck.js": "/assets/duck-1b7a64b3.js",
        "bootstrap": "/assets/vendor/bootstrap/bootstrap.index-f093544d.js"
    }
}</script>
```

Import maps are a native browser feature. When you import `bootstrap` from
JavaScript, the browser will look at the `importmap` and see that it should
fetch the package from the associated path.

But where did the `/assets/duck.js` import entry come from? That doesn't live
in `importmap.php`.

The `assets/app.js` file above imports `./duck.js`. When you import a file using a
relative path, your browser looks for that file relative to the one importing
it. So, it would look for `/assets/duck.js`. That URL *would* be correct,
except that the `duck.js` file is versioned. Fortunately, the AssetMapper component
sees the import and adds a mapping from `/assets/duck.js` to the correct, versioned
filename. The result: importing `./duck.js` just works!

The `importmap()` function also outputs an [ES module shim](https://www.npmjs.com/package/es-module-shims) so that
[older browsers](https://caniuse.com/import-maps) understand importmaps
(see the [polyfill config](current__frontend__asset_mapper.md#config-importmap-polyfill)).

### [The "app" Entrypoint](#the-app-entrypoint "Permalink to this headline")

An "entrypoint" is the main JavaScript file that the browser loads. Most
projects only need the single `app` entrypoint that your app starts with by
default, but you can create additional ones - for example, to load JavaScript
or CSS only on a specific page, as shown in
[Page-Specific CSS & JavaScript](current__frontend__asset_mapper.md#page-specific-assets):

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
```

```
// importmap.php
return [
    'app' => [
        'path' => './assets/app.js',
        'entrypoint' => true,
    ],
    // ...
];
```

In addition to the importmap, the `{{ importmap('app') }}` in
`base.html.twig` outputs a few other things, including:

```
1
```

```
<script type="module">import 'app';</script>
```

This line tells the browser to load the `app` importmap entry, which causes the
code in `assets/app.js` to be executed.

The `importmap()` function also outputs a set of "preloads":

```
1
2
```

```
<link rel="modulepreload" href="/assets/app-4e986c1a.js">
<link rel="modulepreload" href="/assets/duck-1b7a64b3.js">
```

This is a performance optimization and you can learn more about below
in [Performance: Add Preloading](current__frontend__asset_mapper.md#performance-preloading).

### [Browser Support](#browser-support "Permalink to this headline")

Features like importmaps and the `import` statement are supported
in all modern browsers, and the AssetMapper component ships with an [ES module shim](https://www.npmjs.com/package/es-module-shims)
to support `importmap` in old browsers. So, it works everywhere (see note
below).

Inside your own code, if you're relying on modern [ES6](https://caniuse.com/es6) JavaScript features
like the [class syntax](https://caniuse.com/es6-class), this is supported in all but the oldest browsers.
If you *do* need to support very old browsers, you should use a tool like
[Encore](current__frontend.md#frontend-webpack-encore) instead of the AssetMapper component.

Note

The [import statement](https://caniuse.com/es6-module-dynamic-import) can't be polyfilled or shimmed to work on *every*
browser. However, only the **oldest** browsers don't support it.

The `importmap` feature **is** shimmed to work in **all** browsers by the
AssetMapper component (using [es-module-shims](https://www.npmjs.com/package/es-module-shims)). However, this shim only
polyfills **import map** support; it does **not** polyfill the `import()`
syntax itself, which is a native JavaScript feature.

AssetMapper correctly rewrites dynamic imports when the path is a string literal:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
```

```
// static import: works everywhere (shimmed)
import { add } from './math.js';

// dynamic import with a string literal: rewritten by AssetMapper,
// but requires the browser to support import() natively
import('./math.js').then(({ add }) => {
    // ...
});
```

Browsers without [native import support](https://caniuse.com/es6-module-dynamic-import)) will fail regardless of AssetMapper.
For those browsers, you can use [the importShim() function](https://www.npmjs.com/package/es-module-shims#polyfill-edge-case-dynamic-import) provided by the shim.

If you use a transpiler (e.g. Babel, TypeScript) that transforms `import()`
calls, make sure to run it **before** AssetMapper compiles the assets.
Otherwise the file hashes will change after transpilation and the versioned
URLs will break.

### [Importing 3rd Party JavaScript Packages](#importing-3rd-party-javascript-packages "Permalink to this headline")

Suppose you want to use an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com), like [bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap). Technically,
this can be done by importing its full URL, like from a CDN:

```
1
```

```
import { Alert } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/+esm';
```

But yikes! Needing to include that URL is a pain! Instead, you can add this package
to our "importmap" via the `importmap:require` command. This command can be used
to add any [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com):

```
1
```

```
$ php bin/console importmap:require bootstrap
```

Tip

Add the `--dry-run` option to simulate package installation without actually
making any changes (e.g. `php bin/console importmap:require bootstrap --dry-run`)

This adds the `bootstrap` package to your `importmap.php` file:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

```
// importmap.php
return [
    'app' => [
        'path' => './assets/app.js',
        'entrypoint' => true,
    ],
    'bootstrap' => [
        'version' => '5.3.0',
    ],
];
```

Note

Sometimes, a package - like `bootstrap` - will have one or more dependencies,
such as `@popperjs/core`. The `importmap:require` command will add both the
main package *and* its dependencies. If a package includes a main CSS file,
that will also be added (see [Handling 3rd-Party CSS](current__frontend__asset_mapper.md#asset-mapper-3rd-party-css)).

Now you can import the `bootstrap` package like usual:

```
1
2
```

```
import { Alert } from 'bootstrap';
// ...
```

All packages in `importmap.php` are downloaded into an `assets/vendor/` directory,
which should be ignored by git (the Flex recipe adds it to `.gitignore` for you).
You'll need to run the following command to download the files on other computers
if some are missing:

```
1
```

```
$ php bin/console importmap:install
```

### [Importing Specific Files From a 3rd Party Package](#importing-specific-files-from-a-3rd-party-package "Permalink to this headline")

Sometimes you'll need to import a specific file from a package. For example,
suppose you're integrating [highlight.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/highlight.js) and want to import just the core
and a specific language:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

```
import hljs from 'highlight.js/lib/core';
import javascript from 'highlight.js/lib/languages/javascript';

hljs.registerLanguage('javascript', javascript);
hljs.highlightAll();
```

In this case, adding the `highlight.js` package to your `importmap.php` file
won't work: whatever you import - e.g. `highlight.js/lib/core` - needs to
*exactly* match an entry in the `importmap.php` file.

Instead, use `importmap:require` and pass it the exact paths you need. This
also shows how you can require multiple packages at once:

```
1
```

```
$ php bin/console importmap:require highlight.js/lib/core highlight.js/lib/languages/javascript
```

### [Updating 3rd Party Packages](#updating-3rd-party-packages "Permalink to this headline")

You can update your third-party packages to their current versions by running:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
```

```
# lists outdated packages and shows their latest versions
$ php bin/console importmap:outdated
# updates all the outdated packages
$ php bin/console importmap:update

# you can also run the commands only for the given list of packages
$ php bin/console importmap:update bootstrap lodash
$ php bin/console importmap:outdated bootstrap lodash
```

### [Run Security Audits on Your Dependencies](#run-security-audits-on-your-dependencies "Permalink to this headline")

Similar to `npm`, the AssetMapper component comes bundled with a
command that checks security vulnerabilities in the dependencies of your application:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
```

```
$ php bin/console importmap:audit

--------  ---------------------------------------------  ---------  -------  ----------  -----------------------------------------------------
Severity  Title                                          Package    Version  Patched in  More info

--------  ---------------------------------------------  ---------  -------  ----------  -----------------------------------------------------

7 packages found: 7 audited / 0 skipped
6 vulnerabilities found: 1 Critical / 1 High / 4 Medium
```

The command will return the `0` exit code if no vulnerability is found, or
the `1` exit code otherwise. This means that you can seamlessly integrate this
command as part of your CI to be warned anytime a new vulnerability is found.

Tip

The command takes a `--format` option to choose the output format between
`txt` and `json`.

### [Removing JavaScript Packages](#removing-javascript-packages "Permalink to this headline")

If you need to remove a JavaScript package that was previously added to your
`importmap.php` file, use the `importmap:remove` command. For example, to
remove the `lodash` package:

```
1
```

```
$ php bin/console importmap:remove lodash
```

This updates your `importmap.php` file and removes the specified package
(along with any dependencies that were added with it).

After running this command, it's recommended to also run the following to ensure
that your `assets/vendor/` directory is in sync with the updated import map:

```
1
```

```
$ php bin/console importmap:install
```

Tip

Removing a package from the import map does not automatically remove any
references to it in your JavaScript files. Make sure to update your code and
remove any `import` statements that reference the removed package.

### [Global Variables like jQuery](#global-variables-like-jquery "Permalink to this headline")

You might be accustomed to relying on global variables - like jQuery's `$`
variable:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

```
// assets/app.js
import 'jquery';

// app.js or any other file
$('.something').hide(); // WILL NOT WORK!
```

But in a module environment (like with AssetMapper), when you import
a library like `jquery`, it does *not* create a global variable. Instead, you
should import it and set it to a variable in *every* file you need it:

```
1
2
```

```
import $ from 'jquery';
$('.something').hide();
```

You can even do this from an inline script tag:

```
1
2
3
4
```

```
<script type="module">
    import $ from 'jquery';
    $('.something').hide();
</script>
```

If you *do* need something to become a global variable, you do it manually
from inside `app.js`:

```
1
2
3
```

```
import $ from 'jquery';
// things on "window" become global variables
window.$ = $;
```

## [Handling CSS](#handling-css "Permalink to this headline")

CSS can be added to your page by importing it from a JavaScript file. The default
`assets/app.js` already imports `assets/styles/app.css`:

```
1
2
3
4
```

```
// assets/app.js
import '../styles/app.css';

// ...
```

When you call `importmap('app')` in `base.html.twig`, AssetMapper parses
`assets/app.js` (and any JavaScript files that it imports) looking for `import`
statements for CSS files. The final collection of CSS files is rendered onto
the page as `link` tags in the order they were imported.

Note

Importing a CSS file is *not* something that is natively supported by
JavaScript modules. AssetMapper makes this work by adding an empty importmap
entry for each CSS file (e.g. `"/assets/app.css": "data:application/javascript,"`).
These special entries are valid, but do nothing: AssetMapper adds a `<link>`
tag for each CSS file, and when JavaScript executes the `import` statement,
nothing additional happens.

When using a **Content-Security-Policy** with `script-src 'self'`, this
triggers an error because of the `data:` URL. You can either ignore the
error or relax the directive to `script-src 'strict-dynamic'`.

### [Handling 3rd-Party CSS](#handling-3rd-party-css "Permalink to this headline")

Sometimes a JavaScript package will contain one or more CSS files. For example,
the `bootstrap` package has a [dist/css/bootstrap.min.css file](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/bootstrap?tab=files&path=dist%2Fcss#tabRouteFiles).

You can require CSS files in the same way as JavaScript files:

```
1
```

```
$ php bin/console importmap:require bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css
```

To include it on the page, import it from a JavaScript file:

```
1
2
3
4
```

```
// assets/app.js
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

// ...
```

Tip

Some packages - like `bootstrap` - advertise that they contain a CSS
file. In those cases, when you `importmap:require bootstrap`, the
CSS file is also added to `importmap.php` for convenience. If some package
doesn't advertise its CSS file in the `style` property of the
[package.json configuration file](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file) try to contact the package maintainer to
ask them to add that.

### [Paths Inside of CSS Files](#paths-inside-of-css-files "Permalink to this headline")

From inside CSS, you can reference other files using the normal CSS `url()`
function and a relative path to the target file:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

```
/* assets/styles/app.css */
.quack {
    /* file lives at assets/images/duck.png */
    background-image: url('../images/duck.png');
}
```

The path in the final `app.css` file will automatically include the versioned URL
for `duck.png`:

```
1
2
3
4
```

```
/* public/assets/styles/app-3c16d92m.css */
.quack {
    background-image: url('../images/duck-3c16d92m.png');
}
```

### [Lazily Importing CSS from a JavaScript File](#lazily-importing-css-from-a-javascript-file "Permalink to this headline")

If you have some CSS that you want to load lazily, you can do that via
the normal, "dynamic" import syntax:

```
1
2
3
4
```

```
// assets/any-file.js
import('./lazy.css');

// ...
```

In this case, `lazy.css` will be downloaded asynchronously and then added to
the page. If you use a dynamic import to lazily-load a JavaScript file and that
file imports a CSS file (using the non-dynamic `import` syntax), that CSS file
will also be downloaded asynchronously.

## [Importing JSON files](#importing-json-files "Permalink to this headline")

Modern browsers support importing JSON files using the
`import data from './foo.json' with { type: 'json' }` syntax, but browser
support is still limited. AssetMapper provides a compatible alternative that
works in all modern browsers without requiring any bundler.

Instead of using the native syntax, import JSON files using a standard import:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
```

```
// assets/app.js
import dataPromise from './data.json';

// The import returns a Promise that resolves to the JSON content
const data = await dataPromise;
console.log(data.name); // Access your JSON data
```

Consider a JSON file containing user data:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
```

```
{
    "users": [
        {"id": 1, "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"},
        {"id": 2, "name": "Bob", "email": "bob@example.com"}
    ]
}
```

You can import and use this data in your JavaScript:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
```

```
// assets/controllers/user-list-controller.js
import usersPromise from '../data/users.json';

async function displayUsers() {
    const userData = await usersPromise;

    userData.users.forEach(user => {
        console.log(`${user.name}: ${user.email}`);
    });
}

displayUsers();
```

How it Works? When you import a JSON file, AssetMapper detects the import during
asset processing, creates a JavaScript module that exports a Promise resolving
to the JSON content, and adds it to the importmap. The imported JSON file is
versioned like any other asset, so changes to the JSON content will produce a
new filename and browsers will load the updated version.

## [Page-Specific CSS & JavaScript](#page-specific-css-javascript "Permalink to this headline")

Sometimes you may choose to include CSS or JavaScript files only on certain
pages. For JavaScript, one way is to load the file with a [dynamic import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import):

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
```

```
const someCondition = '...';
if (someCondition) {
    import('./some-file.js');

    // or use async/await
    // const something = await import('./some-file.js');
}
```

Another option is to create a separate [entrypoint](current__frontend__asset_mapper.md#app-entrypoint). For
example, create a `checkout.js` file that imports the JavaScript and CSS
needed on that page:

```
1
2
3
4
```

```
// assets/checkout.js
import './checkout.css';

// ...
```

Next, add this to `importmap.php` and mark it as an entrypoint:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

```
// importmap.php
return [
    // the 'app' entrypoint ...

    'checkout' => [
        'path' => './assets/checkout.js',
        'entrypoint' => true,
    ],
];
```

Finally, on the page that needs this JavaScript, call `importmap()` and pass
both `app` and `checkout`:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

```
{# templates/products/checkout.html.twig #}
{#
    Override an "importmap" block from base.html.twig.
    If you don't have that block, add it around the {{ importmap('app') }} call.
#}
{% block importmap %}
    {# do NOT call parent() #}

    {{ importmap(['app', 'checkout']) }}
{% endblock %}
```

The `importmap()` function always includes the full import map to ensure all
module definitions are available on the page. It also adds a `<script type="module">`
tag to load the specific JavaScript entry files you pass to it (in the example
above, the `app.js` file *and* the `checkout.js` file).

Warning

Do not call `parent()` inside the `{% block importmap %}` Twig block. Each
page can include only one import map, so `importmap()` must be called exactly once.

If you want to execute *only* `checkout.js` (and not `app.js`), call
`{{ importmap('checkout') }}`. In this case, the full import map will still be
included in the page, but only the `checkout.js` file will actually be loaded.

## [Integrations](#integrations "Permalink to this headline")

The AssetMapper component focuses on mapping and serving your assets. For
tooling like CSS frameworks, compilers, minifiers or linters, it integrates
with a set of dedicated bundles:

### [Using Tailwind CSS](#using-tailwind-css "Permalink to this headline")

To use the [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) CSS framework with the AssetMapper component, check out
[symfonycasts/tailwind-bundle](https://symfony.com/bundles/TailwindBundle/current/index.html).

### [Using Sass](#using-sass "Permalink to this headline")

To use Sass with AssetMapper component, check out [symfonycasts/sass-bundle](https://symfony.com/bundles/SassBundle/current/index.html).

### [Using TypeScript](#using-typescript "Permalink to this headline")

To use TypeScript with the AssetMapper component, check out [sensiolabs/typescript-bundle](https://github.com/sensiolabs/AssetMapperTypeScriptBundle).

### [Linting & Formatting](#linting-formatting "Permalink to this headline")

To lint and format your front-end assets, install [kocal/biome-js-bundle](https://github.com/Kocal/BiomeJsBundle) in
your project. It's much faster than alternatives like Prettier and requires no
configuration to handle your JavaScript, TypeScript and CSS files.

### [React, Vue & JSX](#react-vue-jsx "Permalink to this headline")

If you're writing an application in React, Svelte or another frontend
framework, you'll probably be better off using *their* tools directly.

JSX *can* be compiled directly to a native JavaScript file but if you're using a lot of JSX,
you'll probably want to use a tool like [Encore](current__frontend.md#frontend-webpack-encore).
See the [UX React Documentation](https://symfony.com/bundles/ux-react/current/index.html) for more details about using it with the AssetMapper
component.

Vue files *can* be written in native JavaScript, and those *will* work with
the AssetMapper component. But you cannot write single-file components (i.e. `.vue`
files), as those must be used in a build system. See the
[UX Vue.js Documentation](https://symfony.com/bundles/ux-vue/current/index.html) for more details about using with the AssetMapper
component.

### [Minification](#minification "Permalink to this headline")

The AssetMapper component doesn't minify assets: in most cases, the compression
performed by web servers before sending them (see [Optimization](current__frontend__asset_mapper.md#optimization))
is sufficient. If you think you could benefit from minifying assets (in addition
to later compressing them), use the [SensioLabs Minify Bundle](https://github.com/sensiolabs/minify-bundle).

This bundle integrates seamlessly with AssetMapper and minifies all web assets
automatically when running the `asset-map:compile` command (as explained in
the [Compiling Assets](current__frontend__asset_mapper.md#asset-mapper-compile-assets) section).

## [Asset Paths in Depth](#asset-paths-in-depth "Permalink to this headline")

The AssetMapper component works with "asset paths": directories whose files are
exposed publicly, optionally under a namespace prefix. Your app starts with a
single one (the `assets/` directory), but you can map more directories, from
your own project, from bundles or even from `node_modules/`. This section
covers where those paths can come from; see the
[paths configuration reference](current__frontend__asset_mapper.md#asset-mapper-paths-config) for all the options.

### [Third-Party Bundles](#third-party-bundles "Permalink to this headline")

All bundles that have a `Resources/public/` or `public/` directory will
automatically have that directory added as an "asset path", using the namespace:
`bundles/<BundleName>`. For example, if you're using [BabdevPagerfantaBundle](https://github.com/BabDev/PagerfantaBundle)
and you run the `debug:asset-map` command, you'll see an asset whose logical
path is `bundles/babdevpagerfanta/css/pagerfanta.css`.

This means you can render these assets in your templates using the
`asset()` function:

```
1
```

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset('bundles/babdevpagerfanta/css/pagerfanta.css') }}">
```

Actually, this path - `bundles/babdevpagerfanta/css/pagerfanta.css` - already
works in applications *without* the AssetMapper component, because the `assets:install`
command copies the assets from bundles into `public/bundles/`. However, when
the AssetMapper component is enabled, the `pagerfanta.css` file will automatically
be versioned! It will output something like:

```
1
```

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/bundles/babdevpagerfanta/css/pagerfanta-ea64fc9c.css">
```

### [Overriding 3rd-Party Assets](#overriding-3rd-party-assets "Permalink to this headline")

If you want to override a 3rd-party asset, you can do that by creating a
file in your `assets/` directory with the same name. For example, if you
want to override the `pagerfanta.css` file, create a file at
`assets/bundles/babdevpagerfanta/css/pagerfanta.css`. This file will be
used instead of the original file.

Note

If a bundle renders their *own* assets, but they use a non-default
[asset package](current__components__asset.md#asset-packages), then the AssetMapper component will
not be used. This happens, for example, with [EasyAdminBundle](https://github.com/EasyCorp/EasyAdminBundle).

### [Importing Assets Outside of the `assets/` Directory](#importing-assets-outside-of-the-assets-directory "Permalink to this headline")

You *can* import assets that live outside of your asset path
(i.e. the `assets/` directory). For example:

```
1
2
3
4
```

```
/* assets/styles/app.css */

/* you can reach above assets/ */
@import url('../../vendor/babdev/pagerfanta-bundle/Resources/public/css/pagerfanta.css');
```

However, if you get an error like this:

> The "app" importmap entry contains the path "vendor/some/package/assets/foo.js"
> but it does not appear to be in any of your asset paths.

It means that you're pointing to a valid file, but that file isn't in any of
your asset paths. You can fix this by adding the path to your `asset_mapper.yaml`
file:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
```

```
# config/packages/asset_mapper.yaml
framework:
    asset_mapper:
        paths:
            - assets/
            - vendor/some/package/assets
```

Then try the command again.

### [Using Local npm Packages](#using-local-npm-packages "Permalink to this headline")

By default, `importmap:require` downloads packages from a CDN. If you prefer
to install packages locally via npm (e.g. to use a specific build or a package
not available on the CDN), you can point AssetMapper to your `node_modules/`
directory.

First, install the package with npm and register the directory containing its
browser-compatible files in your AssetMapper paths:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
```

```
# config/packages/asset_mapper.yaml
framework:
    asset_mapper:
        paths:
            assets/: ''
            node_modules/@hpcc-js/wasm-graphviz/dist/: 'hpcc'
```

Using a namespace (like `hpcc`) for registered directories is highly
recommended to avoid collisions in logical paths. For example, if both
`assets/` and `node_modules/@hpcc-js/wasm-graphviz/dist/` contained an `index.js`
file, only one of them would be mapped without namespaces.

Then, require the package in the importmap using the `--path` option to point
to the local file using its logical path:

```
1
```

```
$ php bin/console importmap:require @hpcc-js/wasm-graphviz --path=hpcc/index.js
```

Now you can import the package as usual:

```
1
```

```
import { Graphviz } from '@hpcc-js/wasm-graphviz';
```

Note

Only the registered directories are served by AssetMapper. All relative
imports inside those directories are resolved automatically. Make sure
the registered directory includes every file the package needs for its
browser imports.

## [Going to Production](#going-to-production "Permalink to this headline")

The AssetMapper component is production ready. It relies on features that all
modern browsers support natively (importmaps and `import` statements) and on
HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, which let the browser download many small files in parallel.

That's also why the component doesn't combine assets into a single file. This
was common in the past to reduce the number of HTTP requests, but it no longer
improves performance. Keeping assets separate also improves caching: when you
update one file, the browser keeps using the cached versions of all the others.

### [Compiling Assets](#compiling-assets "Permalink to this headline")

When you're ready to deploy, "compile" your assets by running this command:

```
1
```

```
$ php bin/console asset-map:compile
```

This will write all your versioned asset files into the `public/assets/` directory,
along with a few JSON files (`manifest.json`, `importmap.json`, etc.) so that
the `importmap` can be rendered lightning fast.

Warning

If you run the `asset-map:compile` command on your development machine,
you won't see any changes made to your assets when reloading the page.
To resolve this, delete the contents of the `public/assets/` directory.
This will allow your Symfony application to serve those assets dynamically again.

Tip

If you need to copy the compiled assets to a different location (e.g. upload
them to S3), create a service that implements `Symfony\Component\AssetMapper\Path\PublicAssetsFilesystemInterface`
and set its service id (or an alias) to `asset_mapper.local_public_assets_filesystem`
(to replace the built-in service).

### [Optimizing Performance](#optimizing-performance "Permalink to this headline")

To make your AssetMapper-powered site fly, there are a few things you need to
do. If you want to take a shortcut, you can use a service like [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/),
which will automatically do most of these things for you:

- **Use HTTP/2**: Your web server should be running HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 so the
  browser can download assets in parallel. HTTP/2 is automatically enabled in Caddy
  and can be activated in Nginx and Apache. Or, proxy your site through a
  service like Cloudflare, which will automatically enable HTTP/2 for you.
- **Compress your assets**: Your web server should compress (e.g. using gzip)
  your assets (JavaScript, CSS, images) before sending them to the browser. This
  is automatically enabled in Caddy and can be activated in Nginx and Apache.
  In Cloudflare, assets are compressed by default. AssetMapper also supports
  [precompressing your web assets](current__frontend__asset_mapper.md#performance-precompressing) to further
  improve performance.
- **Set long-lived cache expiry**: Your web server should set a long-lived
  `Cache-Control` HTTP header on your assets. Because the AssetMapper component includes a version
  hash in the filename of each asset, you can safely set `max-age`
  to a very long time (e.g. 1 year). This isn't automatic in
  any web server, but can be enabled.

Once you've done these things, you can use a tool like [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) to
check the performance of your site.

### [Performance: Understanding Preloading](#performance-understanding-preloading "Permalink to this headline")

One issue that Lighthouse may report is:

> Avoid Chaining Critical Requests

To understand the problem, imagine this theoretical setup:

- `assets/app.js` imports `./duck.js`
- `assets/duck.js` imports `bootstrap`

Without preloading, when the browser downloads the page, the following would happen:

1. The browser downloads `assets/app.js`;
2. It *then* sees the `./duck.js` import and downloads `assets/duck.js`;
3. It *then* sees the `bootstrap` import and downloads `assets/bootstrap.js`.

Instead of downloading all 3 files in parallel, the browser would be forced to
download them one-by-one as it discovers them. That would hurt performance.

AssetMapper avoids this problem by outputting "preload" `link` tags.
The logic works like this:

**A) When you call `importmap('app')` in your template**, the AssetMapper component
looks at the `assets/app.js` file and finds all of the JavaScript files
that it imports or files that those files import, etc.

**B) It then outputs a `link` tag** for each of those files with a `rel="preload"`
attribute. This tells the browser to start downloading those files immediately,
even though it hasn't yet seen the `import` statement for them.

Additionally, if the [WebLink Component](current__web_link.md) is available in your application,
Symfony will add a `Link` header in the response to preload the CSS files.

### [Pre-Compressing Assets](#pre-compressing-assets "Permalink to this headline")

Although most web servers (Caddy, Nginx, Apache, FrankenPHP) and services like Cloudflare
provide asset compression features, AssetMapper also allows you to compress all
your assets before serving them.

This improves performance because you can compress assets using the highest (and
slowest) compression ratios beforehand and provide those compressed assets to the
server, which then returns them to the client without wasting CPU resources on
compression.

AssetMapper supports [Brotli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli), [Zstandard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zstd) and [gzip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip) compression formats.
Before using any of them, the machine that pre-compresses assets must have
installed the following PHP extensions or CLI commands:

- Brotli: `brotli` CLI command; [brotli PHP extension](https://pecl.php.net/package/brotli);
- Zstandard: `zstd` CLI command; [zstd PHP extension](https://pecl.php.net/package/zstd);
- gzip: `zopfli` (better) or `gzip` CLI command; [zlib PHP extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.zlib.php).

Then, update your AssetMapper configuration to define which compression to use
and which file extensions should be compressed:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
```

```
# config/packages/asset_mapper.yaml
framework:
    asset_mapper:
        # ...

        precompress:
            # possible values: 'brotli', 'zstandard', 'gzip'
            format: 'zstandard'

            # you can also pass multiple values to generate files in several formats
            # format: ['brotli', 'zstandard']

            # if you don't define the following option, AssetMapper will compress all
            # the extensions considered safe (css, js, json, svg, xml, ttf, otf, wasm, etc.)
            extensions: ['css', 'js', 'json', 'svg', 'xml']
```

Now, when running the `asset-map:compile` command, all matching files will be
compressed in the configured format and at the highest compression level. The
compressed files are created with the same name as the original but with the
`.br`, `.zst`, or `.gz` extension appended.

Then, you need to configure your web server to serve the precompressed assets
instead of the original ones:

Caddy

Nginx

```
1
2
3
```

```
file_server {
    precompressed br zstd gzip
}
```

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
```

```
gzip_static on;

# Requires https://github.com/google/ngx_brotli
brotli_static on;

# Requires https://github.com/tokers/zstd-nginx-module
zstd_static on;
```

Tip

AssetMapper provides an `assets:compress` CLI command and a service called
`asset_mapper.compressor` that you can use anywhere in your application to
compress any kind of files (e.g. files uploaded by users to your application).

## [Using a Content Security Policy (CSP)](#using-a-content-security-policy-csp "Permalink to this headline")

If you're using a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) (CSP) to prevent cross-site
scripting attacks, the inline `<script>` tags rendered by the `importmap()`
function will likely violate that policy and will not be executed by the browser.

To allow these scripts to run without disabling the security provided by
the CSP, you can generate a secure random string for every request (called
a *nonce*) and include it in the CSP header and in a `nonce` attribute on
the `<script>` tags.
The `importmap()` function accepts an optional second argument that can be
used to pass attributes to the rendered `<script>` tags.
You can use the [NelmioSecurityBundle](https://symfony.com/bundles/NelmioSecurityBundle/current/index.html#nonce-for-inline-script-handling) to generate the nonce and include
it in the CSP header, and then pass the same nonce to the Twig function:

```
1
2
```

```
{# the csp_nonce() function is defined by the NelmioSecurityBundle #}
{{ importmap('app', {'nonce': csp_nonce('script')}) }}
```

### [Content Security Policy and CSS Files](#content-security-policy-and-css-files "Permalink to this headline")

If your importmap includes CSS files, AssetMapper uses a trick to load those by
adding `data:application/javascript` to the rendered importmap (see
[Handling CSS](current__frontend__asset_mapper.md#asset-mapper-handling-css)).

This can cause browsers to report CSP violations and block the CSS files from
being loaded. To prevent this, you can add [strict-dynamic](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src#strict-dynamic) to the `script-src`
directive of your Content Security Policy, to tell the browser that the importmap
is allowed to load other resources.

Note

When using `strict-dynamic`, the browser will ignore any other sources in
`script-src` such as `'self'` or `'unsafe-inline'`, so any other
`<script>` tags will also need to be trusted via a nonce.

## [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting "Permalink to this headline")

There are a few common errors and problems you might run into.

### [Missing importmap Entry](#missing-importmap-entry "Permalink to this headline")

One of the most common errors will come from your browser's console, and
will look something like this:

> Failed to resolve module specifier "bootstrap". Relative references must start
> with either "/", "./", or "../".

or

> The specifier "bootstrap" was a bare specifier, but was not remapped to anything.
> Relative module specifiers must start with "./", "../" or "/".

This means that, somewhere in your JavaScript, you're importing a 3rd party
package - e.g. `import 'bootstrap'`. The browser tries to find this
package in your `importmap` file, but it's not there.

The fix is almost always to add it to your `importmap`:

```
1
```

```
$ php bin/console importmap:require bootstrap
```

Note

Some browsers, like Firefox, show *where* this "import" code lives, while
others like Chrome currently do not.

### [404 Not Found for a JavaScript, CSS or Image File](#404-not-found-for-a-javascript-css-or-image-file "Permalink to this headline")

Sometimes a JavaScript file you're importing (e.g. `import './duck.js'`),
or a CSS/image file you're referencing won't be found, and you'll see a 404
error in your browser's console. You'll also notice that the 404 URL is missing
the version hash in the filename (e.g. a 404 to `/assets/duck.js` instead of
a path like `/assets/duck-1b7a64b3.js`).

This is usually because the path is wrong. If you're referencing the file
directly in a Twig template:

```
1
```

```
<img src="{{ asset('images/duck.png') }}">
```

Then the path that you pass `asset()` should be the "logical path" to the
file. Use the `debug:asset-map` command to see all valid logical paths
in your app.

More likely, you're importing the failing asset from a CSS file (e.g.
`@import url('other.css')`) or a JavaScript file:

```
1
2
```

```
// assets/controllers/farm-controller.js
import '../farm/chicken.js';
```

When doing this, the path should be *relative* to the file that's importing it
(and, in JavaScript files, should start with `./` or `../`). In this case,
`../farm/chicken.js` would point to `assets/farm/chicken.js`. To
see a list of *all* invalid imports in your app, run:

```
1
2
```

```
$ php bin/console cache:clear
$ php bin/console debug:asset-map
```

Any invalid imports will show up as warnings on top of the screen (make sure
you have `symfony/monolog-bundle` installed):

### [Assets Not Updating in dev](#assets-not-updating-in-dev "Permalink to this headline")

When developing your app in debug mode, the AssetMapper component calculates the
content of each asset file and caches it. Whenever that file changes, the component
automatically re-calculates the content.

The system also accounts for "dependencies": If `app.css` contains
`@import url('other.css')`, then the `app.css` file contents will also be
re-calculated whenever `other.css` changes. This is because the version hash of `other.css`
will change... which will cause the final content of `app.css` to change, since
it includes the final `other.css` filename inside.

Mostly, this system just works. But if you have a file that is not being
re-calculated when you expect it to, you can run:

```
1
```

```
$ php bin/console cache:clear
```

This will force the AssetMapper component to re-calculate the content of all files.

Also, remember that if you previously ran the `asset-map:compile` command on
your machine, the compiled files in `public/assets/` take precedence over your
source files. Delete the contents of that directory to let your app serve assets
dynamically again (see [Compiling Assets](current__frontend__asset_mapper.md#asset-mapper-compile-assets)).

### [CDN Connection Issues](#cdn-connection-issues "Permalink to this headline")

If you see a network error like \*Connection was reset for "[https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/..."\*](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/...)
when running the `importmap:require` command, it may be caused by a proxy or
firewall restriction. In that case, you can temporarily configure a proxy to
connect to the `jsDelivr` CDN:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
```

```
# config/packages/framework.yaml
framework:
    # ...
    http_client:
        default_options:
            proxy: 'proxy.example.com:8080'
            # if you use CURL, add extra options:
            extra:
                curl:
                    # 61 is value of constant CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL
                    '61': true
```

### [Package Not Servable by the CDN](#package-not-servable-by-the-cdn "Permalink to this headline")

If the `importmap:require` command fails with a 404 error, there might be some
issue with the JavaScript package that prevents it from being served by the
`jsDelivr` CDN. For example, the package might be missing properties like
`main` or `module` in its [package.json configuration file](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file). This can only
be fixed by the package maintainer. Until then, you can work around the issue by
requiring the exact file you need (see
[Importing Specific Files From a 3rd Party Package](current__frontend__asset_mapper.md#importmaps-specific-files))
or by [using a local npm package](current__frontend__asset_mapper.md#asset-mapper-local-npm).

### [Missing Asset Warnings on Commented-out Code](#missing-asset-warnings-on-commented-out-code "Permalink to this headline")

The AssetMapper component looks in your JavaScript files for `import` lines so
that it can [automatically add them to your importmap](current__frontend__asset_mapper.md#automatic-import-mapping).
This is done via regex and works very well, though it isn't perfect. If you
comment-out an import, it will still be found and added to your importmap. That
doesn't harm anything, but could be surprising.

If the imported path cannot be found, you'll see warning log when that asset
is being built, which you can ignore.

## [Configuration Reference](#configuration-reference "Permalink to this headline")

You can see every available configuration options and some info by running:

```
1
```

```
$ php bin/console config:dump framework asset_mapper
```

Some of the more important options are described below.

### [`framework.asset_mapper.paths`](#framework-asset-mapper-paths "Permalink to this headline")

This config holds all of the directories that will be scanned for assets. This
can be a simple list:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

```
framework:
    asset_mapper:
        paths:
            - assets/
            - vendor/some/package/assets
```

Or you can give each path a "namespace" that will be used in the asset map:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

```
framework:
    asset_mapper:
        paths:
            assets/: ''
            vendor/some/package/assets/: 'some-package'
```

In this case, the "logical path" to all of the files in the `vendor/some/package/assets/`
directory will be prefixed with `some-package` - e.g. `some-package/foo.js`.

### [`framework.asset_mapper.excluded_patterns`](#framework-asset-mapper-excluded-patterns "Permalink to this headline")

This is a list of glob patterns that will be excluded from the asset map:

```
1
2
3
4
```

```
framework:
    asset_mapper:
        excluded_patterns:
            - '*/*.scss'
```

You can use the `debug:asset-map` command to double-check that the files
you expect are being included in the asset map.

### [`framework.asset_mapper.exclude_dotfiles`](#framework-asset-mapper-exclude-dotfiles "Permalink to this headline")

Whether to exclude any file starting with a `.` from the asset mapper. This
is useful if you want to avoid leaking sensitive files like `.env` or
`.gitignore` in the files published by the asset mapper.

```
1
2
3
```

```
framework:
    asset_mapper:
        exclude_dotfiles: true
```

This option is enabled by default.

### [`framework.asset_mapper.importmap_polyfill`](#framework-asset-mapper-importmap-polyfill "Permalink to this headline")

Configure the polyfill for older browsers. By default, the [ES module shim](https://www.npmjs.com/package/es-module-shims) is loaded
via a CDN (i.e. the default value for this setting is `es-module-shims`):

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

```
framework:
    asset_mapper:
        # set this option to false to disable the shim entirely
        # (your website/web app won't work in old browsers)
        importmap_polyfill: false

        # you can also use a custom polyfill by adding it to your importmap.php file
        # and setting this option to the key of that file in the importmap.php file
        # importmap_polyfill: 'custom_polyfill'
```

Tip

You can tell the AssetMapper to load the [ES module shim](https://www.npmjs.com/package/es-module-shims) locally by
using the following command, without changing your configuration:

```
1
```

```
$ php bin/console importmap:require es-module-shims
```

### [`framework.asset_mapper.importmap_script_attributes`](#framework-asset-mapper-importmap-script-attributes "Permalink to this headline")

This is a list of attributes that will be added to the `<script>` tags
rendered by the `{{ importmap() }}` Twig function:

```
1
2
3
4
```

```
framework:
    asset_mapper:
        importmap_script_attributes:
            crossorigin: 'anonymous'
```
