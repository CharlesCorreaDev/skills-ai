## Email package

The Email package provides an interface for sending email using either php's mail function, sendmail
or SMTP. The package supports:

- Plain-text mails
- HTML mails, with and optional alternative body
- Attachments
- Inline attachments.

### Installation

The Email package is part of the official download (since version 1.1). You will have to enable the package
either in the app config or include it on the fly.

```
'always_load' => array(
	'packages' => array(
		'email',
	),
),

// Or in a controller:

\Package::load('email');
```

### Configuration

Create (or copy from the package) a config file at *app/config/email.php*. And change the settings needed.

**Please note:** The Email package loads the email config for you, so there is no need to autoload it.
