## Tasks

### What is a task?

Tasks are classes that can be run through the command line or set up as a cron job. They are generally used for background processes, timed tasks and maintenance tasks. Tasks can calls models and other classes just like controllers.

### Creating a task

In Fuel Tasks are put in the `fuel/app/tasks` directory. Below is an example of the task "example":

```
namespace Fuel\Tasks;

class Example
{

	public function run($message = 'Hello!')
	{
		echo $message;
	}
}
```

That will be called via the refine utility within oil:

```
$ php oil refine example "Good morning"
```

.

When just the name of the task is used in the command, the method `"run()"` is referenced.

### Splitting tasks into more methods

You can add more methods to your task class to break a group of tasks down into more specific tasks which can be called separately.

```
public function current_date()
{
	echo date('Y-m-d');
}
```

We can then call this method using:

```
$ php oil refine example:current_date
```
