## Oil utility

The Oil utility is a special package command can be used in several ways to facilitate quick development, help with
testing your application and for running [Tasks](docs__general__tasks.md).

Oil is an optional command line utility designed to help speed up development by providing several functions:

- [Generate](docs__packages__oil__generate.md) - Build MVC components, migrations and entire scaffolding.
- [Refine](docs__packages__oil__refine.md) - Run tasks such as migrate and your own custom ones.
- [Package](docs__packages__oil__package.md) - Install, update and remove packages.
- [Console](docs__packages__oil__console.md) - Test your code in real time using an interactive shell.
- [Test](docs__packages__oil__test.md) - Run PHPUnit tests.
- [Server](docs__packages__oil__server.md) - Run FuelPHP using the PHP 5.4+ built-in webserver.

Each of these commands works in a different way to achieve different things, but before getting into them it's best to make sure
you are in the correct folder and oil is available and running.

```
$ cd Sites/fuel
$ php oil -v
Fuel: 1.2
```

### Environments

Oil won’t use any instructions you’ve made for HTTP requests, such as defining the server environment using .htaccess. Oil will use whichever environment is the default unless you instruct it.

```
$ FUEL_ENV=production php oil refine migrate
```

In place of `production` you can use any of the defined environments.

### In-line help

Oil contains its own basic documentation which can be found by typing the command:

```
