# WebSocket

The `Websocket` class implements an [RFC 6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455) compatible WebSocket server with event handling.

Namespace: `\CLI`   
File location: `lib/cli/ws.php`

---

## Constructor

```
$server = new \CLI\WS( $addr, resource $ctx = NULL, $wait = 60 );
```

The first argument `$addr` specifies where the server will be listening for connections.
The optional `$ctx` argument accepts the context for the socket
and the `$wait` argument defines the timeout value.

**Examples**

- Listening on the local machine without encryption

  ```
  $server = new CLI\WS('tcp://127.0.0.1:9000');
  ```
- Listening on all IP addresses with encryption

  ```
  $server = new CLI\WS(
      'ssl://0.0.0.0:9000',
      stream_context_create([
          'ssl'=>[
              'local_cert' => '/path/to/.pem',
              'verify_peer' => FALSE,
              'verify_peer_name' => FALSE,
              'allow_self_signed' => TRUE
          ]
      ])
  );
  ```

## Methods

### agents

**Get all agents with a matching URI.**

```
Agent[] agents ( string $uri = NULL )
```

The returned agents can be filtered with the optional `$uri` argument.

### events

**Return the registered event handlers.**

```
array events( )
```

### on

**Bind a function to an event.**

```
\CLI\WS on ( string $event, callable $func )
```

Binds the `$func` hook to the event `$event` and returns itself.
Existing bindings for `$event` are replaced by `$func`.

The section [Event Handlers](websocket.md#event-handlers) lists all events.

### kill

**Properly terminate the server.**

```
void kill ( )
```

The shutdown process triggers the [`stop` event](websocket.md#stop) and terminates the PHP process.

### run

**Execute the server and listen for connections.**

```
void run ( )
```

The `run()` method neither returns a value nor terminates.
Instead, the application is shut down on request (with the [kill()](websocket.md#kill) method or OS signal) or when an error occurs.

## Event Handlers

`Websocket` provides multiple events for customization.
Event handlers are registered with the [`on()` function](websocket.md#on),
e.g. the following example registers an anonymous function for the `start` event.

```
$server->on('start', function(){
    echo 'Server started';
});
```

### start

**The `start` hook is executed when the server is started.**

```
callable start ( \CLI\WS $server )
```

The event handler receives the server as argument.

### error

**The `error` hook is executed when an error occurs.**

```
callable error ( \CLI\WS $server )
```

The event handler receives the server as argument.

### stop

**The `stop` hook is executed when the server (incl. the PHP process) is [shutting down](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.register-shutdown-function.php).**

```
callable stop ( \CLI\WS $server )
```

The event handler receives the server as argument.

### connect

**The `connect` hook is executed when a client connects to a server.**

```
callable connect ( \CLI\Agent $agent )
```

The event handler receives the new [client's agent](websocket.md#agent) as argument.

### disconnect

**The `disconnect` hook is executed when a client disconnects from a server.**

```
callable disconnect ( \CLI\Agent $agent )
```

The event handler receives the disconnecting [client's agent](websocket.md#agent) as argument.
The agent gets destroyed as soon as the handler terminates.

### idle

**The `idle` hook is executed when a client idles.**

```
callable idle ( \CLI\Agent $agent )
```

The event handler receives the [client's agent](websocket.md#agent) as argument.

### receive

**The `receive` hook is executed when application data is received from a client.**

```
callable receive ( \CLI\Agent $agent, $op, $data )
```

The event handler is only called for binary and text frames (see [RFC 6455, Section-11.8](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-11.8)).
Therefore, the event handler receives the operation codes `$op = WS::Binary` (`0x01`) and `$op = WS::Text` (`0x02`).

The event handler receives the [client's agent](websocket.md#agent) as first argument.
The operation code `$op` is either `WS::Binary` or `WS::Text`.
`$data` contains the application-specific payload from the client.

### send

**The `send` hook is executed when application data is sent to a client.**

```
callable send ( \CLI\Agent $agent, $op, $data )
```

The event handler is not called for the pong (`WS::Pong`, `0x0a`) and connection close (`WS:Close`, `0x08`) frames.
Valid operation codes are `WS::Binary` and `WS::Text` (see [RFC 6455, Section-11.8](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-11.8)).

The event handler receives the [client's agent](websocket.md#agent) as first argument.
The operation code `$op` is user-defined (see the section about [Agent](websocket.md#agent)) and should be either `WS::Binary` or `WS::Text`.
`$data` contains the application-specific payload for the client.

## Agent

### server

**Get the server of the agent.**

```
\CLI\WS server ( )
```

### id

**Get the socket ID of the agent.**

```
string id ( )
```

### socket

**Get the socket resource of the agent.**

```
resource socket ( )
```

### verb

**Get the HTTP verb of the agent.**

```
string verb ( )
```

### uri

**Get the HTTP URI of the agent.**

```
string uri ( )
```

### headers

**Get the HTTP headers of the agent.**

```
string[] headers ( )
```

### send

**Send application-specific payload to the client of the agent.**

```
string send ( $op, $data = '' )
```

Valid operation codes `$op` for application frames are `WS::Binary` and `WS::Text` (see [RFC 6455, Section-11.8](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-11.8)).
`$data` contains the application-specific payload for the client.
This method triggers the [`send` event](websocket.md#send).
It returns the sent data.

### fetch

This is an internal method and should be not called manually.
