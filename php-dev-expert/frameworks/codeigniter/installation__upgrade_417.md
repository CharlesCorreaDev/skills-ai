## [Breaking Changes](#id1)[](#breaking-changes "Link to this heading")

- `get_cookie()` when `$xssClean` is true changed the output. Now it uses `FILTER_SANITIZE_FULL_SPECIAL_CHARS`, not `FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING`. Make sure the change is acceptable or not. Note that using XSS filtering is a bad practice. It does not prevent XSS attacks perfectly. Using `esc()` with the correct `$context` in the views is recommended.
