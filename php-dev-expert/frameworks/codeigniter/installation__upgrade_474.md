## [Breaking Changes](#id1)[](#breaking-changes "Link to this heading")

### [HTTPS Detection Behind Proxies](#id2)[](#https-detection-behind-proxies "Link to this heading")

For security reasons, `IncomingRequest::isSecure()` no longer trusts the
`X-Forwarded-Proto` and `Front-End-Https` headers unless the request comes
from a trusted proxy. See the
[Security advisory GHSA-7wmf-pw8j-mc78](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/security/advisories/GHSA-7wmf-pw8j-mc78)
for more information.

If your application runs behind a reverse proxy or load balancer that
terminates TLS, you must register the proxy in `Config\App::$proxyIPs`, e.g.:

```
public array $proxyIPs = [
    '10.0.1.200'     => 'X-Forwarded-For',
    '192.168.5.0/24' => 'X-Forwarded-For',
];
```

Otherwise, `isSecure()`, `force_https()`, and
`Config\App::$forceGlobalSecureRequests` will treat such requests as
non-HTTPS, which may result in redirect loops.

Note

On dual-stack servers, a proxy’s IPv4 address may be reported as an
IPv4-mapped IPv6 address (e.g., `::ffff:192.168.5.21`), which does not
match an IPv4 entry such as `192.168.5.0/24`. In that case, add the
IPv4-mapped form to `Config\App::$proxyIPs`, e.g.,
`::ffff:192.168.5.21` or `::ffff:192.168.5.0/120`.

## [Project Files](#id3)[](#project-files "Link to this heading")

Some files in the **project space** (root, app, public, writable) received updates. Due to
these files being outside of the **system** scope they will not be changed without your intervention.

Note

There are some third-party CodeIgniter modules available to assist
with merging changes to the project space:

### [Content Changes](#id4)[](#content-changes "Link to this heading")
