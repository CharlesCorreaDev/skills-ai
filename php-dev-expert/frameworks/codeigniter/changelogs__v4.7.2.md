## [Bugs Fixed](#id1)[](#bugs-fixed "Link to this heading")

- **Security:** Fixed a bug where the CSRF filter could corrupt JSON request bodies after successful
  verification when the CSRF token was provided via the `X-CSRF-TOKEN` header.
  This caused `IncomingRequest::getJSON()` to fail on valid `application/json` requests.
