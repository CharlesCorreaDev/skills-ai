**4.2.1 release of CodeIgniter4**

## [BREAKING](#id1)[](#breaking "Link to this heading")

### [Behavior Changes](#id2)[](#behavior-changes "Link to this heading")

- Guessing the file extension from the MIME type has been changed if the proposed extension is not valid. Previously, the guessing will early terminate and return `null`. Now, if a proposed extension is given and is invalid, the MIME guessing will continue checking using the mapping of extension to MIME types.
- If there is a cookie with a prefixed name and a cookie with the same name without a prefix, the previous `get_cookie()` had the tricky behavior of returning the cookie without the prefix. Now the behavior has been fixed as a bug, and has been changed. See [Upgrading](installation__upgrade_421.md#upgrade-421-get-cookie) for details.
