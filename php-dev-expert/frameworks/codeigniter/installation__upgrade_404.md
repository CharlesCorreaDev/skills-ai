code implementing the `FilterInterface`.

## [Breaking Changes](#id1)[](#breaking-changes "Link to this heading")

### [Update FilterInterface Declarations](#id2)[](#update-filterinterface-declarations "Link to this heading")

The method signatures for `after()` and `before()` must be updated to include `$arguments`. The function
definitions should be changed from:

```
public function before(RequestInterface $request)
public function after(RequestInterface $request, ResponseInterface $response)
```

to:

```
public function before(RequestInterface $request, $arguments = null)
public function after(RequestInterface $request, ResponseInterface $response, $arguments = null)
```
