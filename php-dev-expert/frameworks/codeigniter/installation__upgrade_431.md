## [Composer Version](#id1)[](#composer-version "Link to this heading")

Important

If you use Composer, CodeIgniter v4.3 requires
Composer 2.0.14 or later.

If you are using older version of Composer, upgrade your `composer` tool,
and delete the **vendor/** directory, and run `composer update` again.

The procedure, for example, is as follows:

```
composer self-update
rm -rf vendor/
composer update
```

## [Mandatory File Changes](#id2)[](#mandatory-file-changes "Link to this heading")

### [Config Files](#id3)[](#config-files "Link to this heading")

#### app/Config/Email.php[](#app-config-email-php "Link to this heading")

- If you updated **app/Config/Email.php** when upgrading to v4.3.0, you must
  set the default values to `$fromEmail`, `$fromName`, `$recipients`,
  `$SMTPHost`, `$SMTPUser` and `$SMTPPass` to apply environment variable
  (**.env**) values.
- If no default values are set, setting environment variables for them will not
  be reflected in the Config object.

#### app/Config/Exceptions.php[](#app-config-exceptions-php "Link to this heading")

- If you are using PHP 8.2, you need to add new properties `$logDeprecations` and `$deprecationLogLevel`.

## [Project Files](#id4)[](#project-files "Link to this heading")

Some files in the **project space** (root, app, public, writable) received updates. Due to
these files being outside of the **system** scope they will not be changed without your intervention.

There are some third-party CodeIgniter modules available to assist with merging changes to
the project space: [Explore on Packagist](https://packagist.org/explore/?query=codeigniter4%20updates).

### [Content Changes](#id5)[](#content-changes "Link to this heading")

The following files received significant changes (including deprecations or visual adjustments)
and it is recommended that you merge the updated versions with your application:

#### Config[](#config "Link to this heading")

- app/Config/Email.php
  :   - Set the default value `''` to `$fromEmail`, `$fromName`,
        `$recipients`, `$SMTPHost`, `$SMTPUser` and `$SMTPPass`
        to apply environment variable (**.env**) values.

### [All Changes](#id6)[](#all-changes "Link to this heading")

This is a list of all files in the **project space** that received changes;
many will be simple comments or formatting that have no effect on the runtime:

- app/Config/Email.php
- composer.json
