- Added `Language.invalidMessageFormat` error message.

## [Changes](#id2)[](#changes "Link to this heading")

- **Database Migrations:** The `-g` option for the `spark migrate:rollback`

  specify only a specific database group.

## [Deprecations](#id3)[](#deprecations "Link to this heading")

- **Filters:** The Auto-Discovery for Filters and `Filters::discoverFilters()`
  is deprecated. Use [Registrars](general__configuration.md#registrars) instead. See [Filters](general__modules.md#modules-filters) for
  details.
- **CLI:** The public property `CLI::$readline_support` and `CLI::$wait_msg`
  are deprecated. These methods will be protected.
- **CodeIgniter:** The parameter `$config` for the `displayCache()` method is
  deprecated. It was not used.

- **CodeIgniter:** Fixed a bug that returned “200 OK” response status code when
  Page Not Found.
- **Spark:** Fixed a bug that caused spark to not display exceptions in the
  production mode or to display backtrace in json when an exception occurred.
