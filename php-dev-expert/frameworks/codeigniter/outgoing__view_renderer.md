## [Using the View Renderer](#id1)[](#using-the-view-renderer "Link to this heading")

The [`view()`](general__common_functions.md#view "view") function is a convenience function that grabs an instance of the
`renderer` service, sets the data, and renders the view. While this is often
exactly what you want, you may find times where you want to work with it more directly.
In that case you can access the View service directly:

```
$view = service('renderer');
```

Alternately, if you are not using the `View` class as your default renderer, you
can instantiate it directly:

```
$view = new \CodeIgniter\View\View();
```

Important

You should create services only within controllers. If you need
access to the View class from a library, you should set that as a dependency
in your library’s constructor.

Then you can use any of the three standard methods that it provides:
[`render()`](#CodeIgniter\View\View::render "CodeIgniter\View\View::render"),
[`setVar()`](#CodeIgniter\View\View::setVar "CodeIgniter\View\View::setVar") and
[`setData()`](#CodeIgniter\View\View::setData "CodeIgniter\View\View::setData").

### [What It Does](#id2)[](#what-it-does "Link to this heading")

The `View` class processes conventional HTML/PHP scripts stored in the application’s view path,
after extracting view parameters into PHP variables, accessible inside the scripts.
This means that your view parameter names need to be legal PHP variable names.

The View class uses an associative array internally, to accumulate view parameters
until you call its `render()`. This means that your parameter (or variable) names
need to be unique, or a later variable setting will over-ride an earlier one.

This also impacts escaping parameter values for different contexts inside your
script. You will have to give each escaped value a unique parameter name.

No special meaning is attached to parameters whose value is an array. It is up
to you to process the array appropriately in your PHP code.

### [Setting View Parameters](#id3)[](#setting-view-parameters "Link to this heading")

The [`setVar()`](#CodeIgniter\View\View::setVar "CodeIgniter\View\View::setVar") method sets a view parameter.

```
$view->setVar('name', 'Joe', 'html');
```

The [`setData()`](#CodeIgniter\View\View::setData "CodeIgniter\View\View::setData") method sets multiple view
parameters at once.

```
$view->setData(['name' => 'George', 'position' => 'Boss']);
```

### [Method Chaining](#id4)[](#method-chaining "Link to this heading")

The `setVar()` and `setData()` methods are chainable, allowing you to combine a
number of different calls together in a chain:

```
$view->setVar('one', $one)
    ->setVar('two', $two)
    ->render('myView');
```

### [Escaping Data](#id5)[](#escaping-data "Link to this heading")

When you pass data to the `setVar()` and `setData()` functions you have the option to escape the data to protect
against cross-site scripting attacks. As the last parameter in either method, you can pass the desired context to
escape the data for. See below for context descriptions.

If you don’t want the data to be escaped, you can pass `null` or `'raw'` as the final parameter to each function:

```
$view->setVar('one', $one, 'raw');
```

If you choose not to escape data, or you are passing in an object instance, you can manually escape the data within
the view with the [`esc()`](general__common_functions.md#esc "esc") function. The first parameter is the string to escape. The second parameter is the
context to escape the data for (see below):

```
<?= esc($object->getStat()) ?>
```

#### Escaping Contexts[](#escaping-contexts "Link to this heading")

By default, the `esc()` and, in turn, the `setVar()` and `setData()` functions assume that the data you want to
escape is intended to be used within standard HTML. However, if the data is intended for use in Javascript, CSS,
or in an href attribute, you would need different escaping rules to be effective. You can pass in the name of the
context as the second parameter. Valid contexts are `'html'`, `'js'`, `'css'`, `'url'`, and `'attr'`:

```
<a href="<?= esc($url, 'url') ?>" data-foo="<?= esc($bar, 'attr') ?>">Some Link</a>

<script>
    var siteName = '<?= esc($siteName, 'js') ?>';
</script>

<style>
    body {
        background-color: <?= esc('bgColor', 'css') ?>
    }
</style>
```

### [View Renderer Options](#id6)[](#view-renderer-options "Link to this heading")

Several options can be passed to the `render()` or `renderString()` methods:

- `$options`

  > - `cache` - the time in seconds, to save a view’s results; ignored for
  >   `renderString()`.
  > - `cache_name` - the ID used to save/retrieve a cached view result; defaults
  >   to the `$viewPath`; ignored for `renderString()`.
  > - `debug` - can be set to false to disable the addition of debug code for
  >   [Debug Toolbar](testing__debugging.md#the-debug-toolbar).
- `$saveData` - true if the view data parameters should be retained for
  subsequent calls.

Note

`$saveData` as defined by the interface must be a boolean, but implementing
classes (like `View` below) may extend this to include `null` values.

## [Class Reference](#id7)[](#class-reference "Link to this heading")

*class* CodeIgniter\View\View[](#CodeIgniter\View\View "Link to this definition")
:   render(*$view*[, *$options*[, *$saveData = false*]])[](#CodeIgniter\View\View::render "Link to this definition")
    :   Parameters:
        :   - **$view** (`string`) – File name of the view source
            - **$options** (`array`) – Array of options, as key/value pairs
            - **$saveData** (`boolean|null`) – If true, will save data for use with any other calls. If false, will clean the data after rendering the view. If null, uses the config setting.

        Returns:
        :   The rendered text for the chosen view

        Return type:
        :   `string`

        Builds the output based upon a file name and any data that has already been set:

        ```
        echo $view->render('myview');
        ```

    renderString(*$view*[, *$options*[, *$saveData = false*]])[](#CodeIgniter\View\View::renderString "Link to this definition")
    :   Parameters:
        :   - **$view** (`string`) – Contents of the view to render, executed as PHP code
            - **$options** (`array`) – Array of options, as key/value pairs
            - **$saveData** (`boolean|null`) – If true, will save data for use with any other calls. If false, will clean the data after rendering the view. If null, uses the config setting.

        Returns:
        :   The rendered text for the chosen view

        Return type:
        :   `string`

        Builds the output based upon a view fragment and any data that has already been set:

        ```
        echo $view->renderString('<div>My Sharona</div>');
        ```

    Warning

    `renderString()` executes the given view contents as PHP code,
    just like a view file. Treat them as trusted code: never pass contents that
    less-trusted users can edit, even if they are stored in your database.
    Escaping or validating such contents does not make them safe to execute.
    Pass user-provided values as view data instead.

    setData([*$data*[, *$context = null*]])[](#CodeIgniter\View\View::setData "Link to this definition")
    :   Parameters:
        :   - **$data** (`array`) – Array of view data strings, as key/value pairs
            - **$context** (`string`) – The context to use for data escaping.

        Returns:
        :   The Renderer, for method chaining

        Return type:
        :   `CodeIgniter\View\RendererInterface.`

        Sets several pieces of view data at once:

        ```
        $view->setData(['name' => 'George', 'position' => 'Boss']);
        ```

        Supported escape contexts: `html`, `css`, `js`, `url`, or `attr` or `raw`.
        If `'raw'`, no escaping will happen.

        Each call adds to the array of data that the object is accumulating,
        until the view is rendered.

    setVar(*$name*[, *$value = null*[, *$context = null*]])[](#CodeIgniter\View\View::setVar "Link to this definition")
    :   Parameters:
        :   - **$name** (`string`) – Name of the view data variable
            - **$value** (`mixed`) – The value of this view data
            - **$context** (`string`) – The context to use for data escaping.

        Returns:
        :   The Renderer, for method chaining

        Return type:
        :   `CodeIgniter\View\RendererInterface.`

        Sets a single piece of view data:

        ```
        $view->setVar('name', 'Joe', 'html');
        ```

        Supported escape contexts: `html`, `css`, `js`, `url`, `attr` or `raw`.
        If `'raw'`, no escaping will happen.

        If you use the a view data variable that you have previously used
        for this object, the new value will replace the existing one.
