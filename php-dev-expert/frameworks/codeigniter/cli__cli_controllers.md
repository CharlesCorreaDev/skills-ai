# Running Controllers via CLI[](#running-controllers-via-cli "Link to this heading")

As well as calling an application’s [Controllers](incoming__controllers.md)
via the URL in a browser they can also be loaded via the command-line
interface (CLI).

Note

It is recommended to use Spark Commands for CLI scripts instead of
calling controllers via CLI.
See the [Spark Commands](cli__spark_commands.md) and [Creating Spark Commands](cli__cli_commands.md) page for detailed
information.

## [Let’s try it: Hello World!](#id1)[](#let-s-try-it-hello-world "Link to this heading")

### [Create a Controller](#id2)[](#create-a-controller "Link to this heading")

Let’s create a simple controller so you can see it in action. Using your
text editor, create a file called Tools.php, and put the following code
in it:

```
<?php

namespace App\Controllers;

use CodeIgniter\Controller;

class Tools extends Controller
{
    public function message($to = 'World')
    {
        return "Hello {$to}!" . PHP_EOL;
    }
}
```

Note

If you use [Auto Routing (Improved)](incoming__auto_routing_improved.md#auto-routing-improved), change the method name to `cliMessage()`.

Then save the file to your **app/Controllers/** directory.

### [Define a Route](#id3)[](#define-a-route "Link to this heading")

If you use Auto Routing, skip this.

In your **app/Config/Routes.php** file you can create routes that are only accessible from
the CLI as easily as you would create any other route. Instead of using the `get()`,
`post()`, or similar method, you would use the `cli()` method. Everything else
works exactly like a normal route definition:

```
<?php

$routes->cli('tools/message/(:segment)', 'Tools::message/$1');
```

For more information, see the [Routes](incoming__routing.md#command-line-only-routes) page.

Warning

If you enable [Auto Routing (Legacy)](incoming__routing.md#auto-routing-legacy) and place the command file in **app/Controllers**,
anyone could access the command with the help of [Auto Routing (Legacy)](incoming__routing.md#auto-routing-legacy) via HTTP.

### [Run via CLI](#id4)[](#run-via-cli "Link to this heading")

Now normally you would visit your site using a URL similar to this:

```
example.com/index.php/tools/message/to
```

Instead, we are going to open Terminal in Mac/Linux or go to Run > “cmd”
in Windows and navigate to our CodeIgniter project’s web root.

```
$ cd /path/to/project/public
$ php index.php tools message
```

If you did it right, you should see “Hello World!” printed.

```
$ php index.php tools message "John Smith"
```

Here we are passing it an argument in the same way that URL parameters
work. “John Smith” is passed as an argument and output is:

```
Hello John Smith!
```

## [That’s the Basics!](#id5)[](#that-s-the-basics "Link to this heading")

That, in a nutshell, is all there is to know about controllers on the
command line. Remember that this is just a normal controller, so routing
and `_remap()` works fine.

Note

`_remap()` does not work with [Auto Routing (Improved)](incoming__auto_routing_improved.md#auto-routing-improved).

If you want to make sure running via CLI, check the return value of [`is_cli()`](general__common_functions.md#is_cli "is_cli").

However, CodeIgniter provides additional tools to make creating CLI-accessible
scripts even more pleasant, include CLI-only routing, and a library that helps
you with CLI-only tools.
