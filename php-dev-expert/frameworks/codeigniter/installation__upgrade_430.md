## [Composer Version](#id1)[](#composer-version "Link to this heading")

Important

If you use Composer, CodeIgniter v4.3.0 requires
Composer 2.0.14 or later.

If you are using older version of Composer, upgrade your `composer` tool,
and delete the **vendor/** directory, and run `composer update` again.

The procedure, for example, is as follows:

```
composer self-update
rm -rf vendor/
composer update
```

## [Mandatory File Changes](#id2)[](#mandatory-file-changes "Link to this heading")

### [spark](#id3)[](#spark "Link to this heading")

The following files received significant changes and
**you must merge the updated versions** with your application:

- `spark`

Important

If you do not update this file, Spark commands will not work at all after running `composer update`.

The upgrade procedure, for example, is as follows:

```
composer update
cp vendor/codeigniter4/framework/spark .
```

### [Config Files](#id4)[](#config-files "Link to this heading")

#### app/Config/Kint.php[](#app-config-kint-php "Link to this heading")

- **app/Config/Kint.php** has been updated for Kint 5.0.
- You need to replace:

  > - `Kint\Renderer\Renderer` with `Kint\Renderer\AbstractRenderer`
  > - `Renderer::SORT_FULL` with `AbstractRenderer::SORT_FULL`

#### app/Config/Exceptions.php[](#app-config-exceptions-php "Link to this heading")

- If you are using PHP 8.2, you need to add new properties `$logDeprecations` and `$deprecationLogLevel`.

#### Mock Config Classes[](#mock-config-classes "Link to this heading")

- If you are using the following Mock Config classes in testing, you need to update the corresponding Config files in **app/Config**:

  > - `MockAppConfig` (`Config\App`)
  > - `MockCLIConfig` (`Config\App`)
  > - `MockSecurityConfig` (`Config\Security`)
- Add **types** to the properties in these Config classes. You may need to fix the property values to match the property types.

### [composer.json](#id5)[](#composer-json "Link to this heading")

If you installed CodeIgnter manually, and are using Composer,
you need to remove the following lines, and run `composer update`.

```
{
    ...
    "require": {
        ...
        "kint-php/kint": "^4.2",  <-- Remove this line
        ...
    },
    ...
    "scripts": {
        "post-update-cmd": [
            "CodeIgniter\\ComposerScripts::postUpdate"  <-- Remove this line
        ],
        "test": "phpunit"
    },
    ...
}
```

## [Breaking Changes](#id6)[](#breaking-changes "Link to this heading")

### [Database Exception Changes](#id7)[](#database-exception-changes "Link to this heading")

- The exception classes may be changed when database errors occur. If you catch the exceptions,
  you must confirm that your code can catch the exceptions.
- Now a few exceptions will be thrown even if `CI_DEBUG` is false.
- During transactions, exceptions are not thrown by default even if `DBDebug` is true. If you want
  exceptions to be thrown, you need to call `transException(true)`.
  See [Throwing Exceptions](database__transactions.md#transactions-throwing-exceptions).
- See [Exceptions when Database Errors Occur](changelogs__v4.3.0.md#exceptions-when-database-errors-occur) for details.

### [HTTP Status Code and Exit Code of Uncaught Exceptions](#id8)[](#http-status-code-and-exit-code-of-uncaught-exceptions "Link to this heading")

- If you expect *Exception code* as *HTTP status code*, the HTTP status code will be changed.
  In that case, you need to implement `HTTPExceptionInterface` in the Exception. See [Specify HTTP Status Code in Your Exception](general__errors.md#error-specify-http-status-code).
- If you expect *Exit code* based on *Exception code*, the Exit code will be changed.
  In that case, you need to implement `HasExitCodeInterface` in the Exception. See [Specify Exit Code in Your Exception](general__errors.md#error-specify-exit-code).

### [redirect()->withInput() and Validation Errors](#id9)[](#redirect-withinput-and-validation-errors "Link to this heading")

`redirect()->withInput()` and Validation errors had an undocumented behavior.
If you redirect with `withInput()`, CodeIgniter stores the validation errors
in the session, and you can get the errors in the redirected page from
a validation object *before a new validation is run*:

```
// In the controller
if (! $this->validate($rules)) {
    return redirect()->back()->withInput();
}

// In the view of the redirected page
<?= service('Validation')->listErrors() ?>
```

This behavior was a bug and fixed in v4.3.0.

If you have code that depends on the bug, you need to change the code.
Use new Form helpers, [`validation_errors()`](helpers__form_helper.md#validation_errors "validation_errors"), [`validation_list_errors()`](helpers__form_helper.md#validation_list_errors "validation_list_errors") and [`validation_show_error()`](helpers__form_helper.md#validation_show_error "validation_show_error") to display Validation Errors,
instead of the Validation object.

### [Validation Changes](#id10)[](#validation-changes "Link to this heading")

- `ValidationInterface` has been changed. Implemented classes should likewise add the methods and the parameters so as not to break LSP. See [Validation Changes](changelogs__v4.3.0.md#v430-validation-changes) for details.
- The return value of `Validation::loadRuleGroup()` has been changed `null` to `[]` when the `$group` is empty. Update the code if you depend on the behavior.

### [Time Fixes](#id11)[](#time-fixes "Link to this heading")

- Due to bug fixes, some methods in [Time](libraries__time.md) have changed from mutable behavior to immutable; `Time` now extends `DateTimeImmutable`. See [ChangeLog](changelogs__v4.3.0.md#v430-time-fix) for details.
- If you need the behavior of `Time` before the modification, a compatible `TimeLegacy` class has been added. Please replace all `Time` with `TimeLegacy` in your application code.
- But `TimeLegacy` is deprecated. So we recommend you update your code.

E.g.:

```
// Before
$time = Time::now();
// ...
if ($time instanceof DateTime) {
    // ...
}

// After
$time = Time::now();
// ...
if ($time instanceof DateTimeInterface) {
    // ...
}
```

```
// Before
$time1 = new Time('2022-10-31 12:00');
$time2 = $time1->modify('+1 day');
echo $time1; // 2022-11-01 12:00:00
echo $time2; // 2022-11-01 12:00:00

// After
$time1 = new Time('2022-10-31 12:00');
$time2 = $time1->modify('+1 day');
echo $time1; // 2022-10-31 12:00:00
echo $time2; // 2022-11-01 12:00:00
```

### [Capturing STDERR and STDOUT streams in Tests](#id12)[](#capturing-stderr-and-stdout-streams-in-tests "Link to this heading")

The way error and output streams are captured has changed. Now instead of:

```
use CodeIgniter\Test\Filters\CITestStreamFilter;

protected function setUp(): void
{
    CITestStreamFilter::$buffer = '';
    $this->streamFilter         = stream_filter_append(STDOUT, 'CITestStreamFilter');
    $this->streamFilter         = stream_filter_append(STDERR, 'CITestStreamFilter');
}

protected function tearDown(): void
{
    stream_filter_remove($this->streamFilter);
}
```

need to use:

```
use CodeIgniter\Test\Filters\CITestStreamFilter;

protected function setUp(): void
{
    CITestStreamFilter::registration();
    CITestStreamFilter::addOutputFilter();
    CITestStreamFilter::addErrorFilter();
}

protected function tearDown(): void
{
    CITestStreamFilter::removeOutputFilter();
    CITestStreamFilter::removeErrorFilter();
}
```

Or use the trait `CodeIgniter\Test\StreamFilterTrait`. See [Testing CLI Output](testing__cli.md#testing-cli-output).

### [Interface Changes](#id13)[](#interface-changes "Link to this heading")

Some interfaces has been fixed. See [Interface Changes](changelogs__v4.3.0.md#v430-interface-changes) for details.

### [Foreign Key Data](#id14)[](#foreign-key-data "Link to this heading")

- The data structure returned by `BaseConnection::getForeignKeyData()` has been changed.
  You will need to adjust any code depending on this method to use the new structure.

Example: `tableprefix_table_column1_column2_foreign`

The data returned has the following structure:

```
/**
 * @return array[
 *    {constraint_name} =>
 *        stdClass[
 *            'constraint_name'     => string,
 *            'table_name'          => string,
 *            'column_name'         => string[],
 *            'foreign_table_name'  => string,
 *            'foreign_column_name' => string[],
 *            'on_delete'           => string,
 *            'on_update'           => string,
 *            'match'               => string
 *        ]
 * ]
 */
```

## [Breaking Enhancements](#id15)[](#breaking-enhancements "Link to this heading")

### [Multiple Domain Support](#id16)[](#multiple-domain-support "Link to this heading")

- If you set `Config\App::$allowedHostnames`, URL-related functions such as [`base_url()`](helpers__url_helper.md#base_url "base_url"), [`current_url()`](helpers__url_helper.md#current_url "current_url"), [`site_url()`](helpers__url_helper.md#site_url "site_url") will return the URL with the hostname set in `Config\App::$allowedHostnames` if the current URL matches.

### [Database](#id17)[](#database "Link to this heading")

- The return type of `CodeIgniter\Database\Database::loadForge()` has been changed to `Forge`. Extending classes should likewise change the type.
- The return type of `CodeIgniter\Database\Database::loadUtils()` has been changed to `BaseUtils`. Extending classes should likewise change the type.
- The second parameter `$index` of `BaseBuilder::updateBatch()` has changed to `$constraints`. It now accepts types array, string, or `RawSql`. Extending classes should likewise change types.
- The `$set` parameter of `BaseBuilder::insertBatch()` and `BaseBuilder::updateBatch()` now accepts an object of a single row of data. Extending classes should likewise change the type.
- The third parameter `$index` of `BaseBuilder::_updateBatch()` has changed to `$values`, and the parameter type has changed to `array`. Extending classes should likewise change the type.
- The `Model::update()` method now raises a `DatabaseException` if it generates an SQL
  statement without a WHERE clause. If you need to update all records in a table, use Query Builder instead. E.g., `$model->builder()->update($data)`.

### [Honeypot and CSP](#id18)[](#honeypot-and-csp "Link to this heading")

When CSP is enabled, id attribute `id="hpc"` will be injected into the container tag
for the Honeypot field to hide the field. If the id is already used in your views, you need to change it
with `Config\Honeypot::$containerId`.
And you can remove `style="display:none"` in `Config\Honeypot::$container`.

### [Others](#id19)[](#others "Link to this heading")

- **Helper:** Since void HTML elements (e.g. `<input>`) in `html_helper`, `form_helper` or common functions have been changed to be HTML5-compatible by default and you need to be compatible with XHTML, you must set the `$html5` property in **app/Config/DocTypes.php** to `false`.
- **CLI:** Since the launch of Spark Commands was extracted from `CodeIgniter\CodeIgniter`, there may be problems running these commands if the `Services::codeigniter()` service has been overridden.

## [Project Files](#id20)[](#project-files "Link to this heading")

Numerous files in the **project space** (root, app, public, writable) received updates. Due to
these files being outside of the **system** scope they will not be changed without your intervention.
There are some third-party CodeIgniter modules available to assist with merging changes to
the project space: [Explore on Packagist](https://packagist.org/explore/?query=codeigniter4%20updates).

### [Content Changes](#id21)[](#content-changes "Link to this heading")

- app/Config/App.php
  :   - The new property `$allowedHostnames` is added to set allowed hostnames in the site URL
        other than the hostname in the `$baseURL`. See [Multiple Domain Support](changelogs__v4.3.0.md#v430-multiple-domain-support).
      - The property `$appTimezone` has been changed to `UTC` to avoid being affected
        by daylight saving time.
- app/Config/Autoload.php
  :   - The new property `$helpers` is added to autoload helpers.
- app/Config/Database.php

- app/Config/DocTypes.php
  :   - The property `$html5` to determine whether to remove the solidus (`/`) character for void HTML
        elements (e.g. `<input>`) is added, and set to `true` by default for HTML5 compatibility.
- app/Config/Encryption.php
  :   - The new property `$rawData`, `$encryptKeyInfo`, and `$authKeyInfo` are added for CI3
        Encryption compatibility. See [Configuration to Maintain Compatibility with CI3](libraries__encryption.md#encryption-compatible-with-ci3).
- app/Config/Exceptions.php
  :   - Two additional public properties were added: `$logDeprecations` and `$deprecationLogLevel`.

        to load the internal routes of the framework (`SYSTEMPATH . 'Config/Routes.php'`).
- app/Config/Security.php
  :   - Changed the value of the property `$redirect` to `false` to prevent redirection when a CSRF
        check fails. This is to make it easier to recognize that it is a CSRF error.
- app/Config/Session.php
  :   - Added to handle session configuration.
- app/Config/Validation.php
  :   - The default Validation Rules have been changed to Strict Rules for better security. See [Traditional and Strict Rules](libraries__validation.md#validation-traditional-and-strict-rules).
