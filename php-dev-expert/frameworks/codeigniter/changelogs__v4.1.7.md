**4.1.7 release of CodeIgniter4**

## [BREAKING](#id1)[](#breaking "Link to this heading")

- Because `FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING` is deprecated since PHP 8.1, `get_cookie()` that uses it when `$xssClean` is true changed the output. Now it uses `FILTER_SANITIZE_FULL_SPECIAL_CHARS`. Note that using XSS filtering is a bad practice. It does not prevent XSS attacks perfectly. Using `esc()` with the correct `$context` in the views is recommended.
