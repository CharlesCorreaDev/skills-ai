## [BREAKING](#id1)[](#breaking "Link to this heading")

### [Time::createFromTimestamp()](#id2)[](#time-createfromtimestamp "Link to this heading")

A bug that caused [Time::createFromTimestamp()](libraries__time.md#time-createfromtimestamp)
to return a Time instance with a timezone of UTC has been fixed.

Starting with this version, when you do not specify a timezone, a Time instance
with the app’s timezone is returned by default.

## [Bugs Fixed](#id3)[](#bugs-fixed "Link to this heading")

- **Session:** Fixed a bug in Redis session handler that caused locking to fail
  and the session data to be cleared.
- **DB Forge:** Fixed a bug in SQLite3 Forge that caused `Forge::modifyColumn()`
  to incorrectly modify table definitions.
- **CSP:** Fixed a bug that CSP blocked some elements in the Debug Toolbar.
