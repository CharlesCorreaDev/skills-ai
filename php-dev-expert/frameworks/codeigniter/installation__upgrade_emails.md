# Upgrade Emails[](#upgrade-emails "Link to this heading")

## [Documentations](#id1)[](#documentations "Link to this heading")

- [Email Documentation CodeIgniter 3.x](https://codeigniter.com/userguide3/libraries/email.html)
- [Email Documentation CodeIgniter 4.x](libraries__email.md)

## [What has been changed](#id2)[](#what-has-been-changed "Link to this heading")

- Only small things like the method names and the loading of the library have changed.
- The behavior when using the SMTP protocol has been slightly changed. You may not be able to communicate with your SMTP server properly if you use the CI3 settings. See [SSL versus TLS for SMTP Protocol](libraries__email.md#email-ssl-tls-for-smtp) and [Email Preferences](libraries__email.md#email-preferences).

## [Upgrade Guide](#id3)[](#upgrade-guide "Link to this heading")

1. Within your class change the `$this->load->library('email');` to `$email = service('email');`.
2. From that on you have to replace every line starting with `$this->email` to `$email`.
3. The methods in the Email class are named slightly different. All methods, except for `send()`, `attach()`, `printDebugger()` and `clear()` have a `set` as prefix followed by the previous method name. `bcc()` is now `setBcc()` and so on.
4. The config attributes in **app/Config/Email.php** have changed. You should have a look at the [Setting Email Preferences](libraries__email.md#setting-email-preferences) to have a list of the new attributes.
