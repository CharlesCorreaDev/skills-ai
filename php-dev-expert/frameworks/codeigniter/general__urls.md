# CodeIgniter URLs[](#codeigniter-urls "Link to this heading")

By default, URLs in CodeIgniter are designed to be search-engine and human-friendly. Rather than using the standard
“query-string” approach to URLs that is synonymous with dynamic systems, CodeIgniter uses a **segment-based** approach:

```
https://example.com/news/article/my_article
```

Your URLs can be defined using the [URI Routing](incoming__routing.md) feature with flexibility.

The [URI Library](libraries__uri.md) and the [URL Helper](helpers__url_helper.md) contain functions that make it easy to work with your URI data.

## [URL Structure](#id1)[](#url-structure "Link to this heading")

### [Base URL contains only the Hostname](#id2)[](#base-url-contains-only-the-hostname "Link to this heading")

When you have the Base URL **https://www.example.com/** and imagine the following URL:

```
https://www.example.com/blog/news/2022/10?page=2
```

We use the following terms:

| Term | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Base URL | **https://www.example.com/** | Base URL is often denoted as **baseURL**. |
| URI path | /blog/news/2022/10 |  |
| Route path | /blog/news/2022/10 | The URI path relative to the Base URL. It is also called as **URI string**. |
| Query | page=2 |  |

### [Base URL contains Sub folders](#id3)[](#base-url-contains-sub-folders "Link to this heading")

When you have the Base URL **https://www.example.com/ci-blog/** and imagine the following URL:

```
https://www.example.com/ci-blog/blog/news/2022/10?page=2
```

We use the following terms:

| Term | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Base URL | **https://www.example.com/ci-blog/** | Base URL is often denoted as **baseURL**. |
| URI path | /ci-blog/blog/news/2022/10 |  |
| Route path | /blog/news/2022/10 | The URI path relative to the Base URL. It is also called as **URI string**. |
| Query | page=2 |  |

## [URI Security](#id4)[](#uri-security "Link to this heading")

Added in version 4.4.7.

Important

Users upgrading from versions prior to v4.4.7 will need to add the following
to **app/Config/App.php** in order to use this feature:

```
public string $permittedURIChars = 'a-z 0-9~%.:_\-';
```

CodeIgniter is fairly restrictive regarding which characters it allows in your
URI strings (Route path) in order to help minimize the possibility that malicious
data can be passed to your application. URIs may only contain the following:

- Alpha-numeric text (latin characters only)
- Tilde: `~`
- Percent sign: `%`
- Period: `.`
- Colon: `:`
- Underscore: `_`
- Dash: `-`
- Space: `` ``

Note

This check is performed by the `Router`. The Router takes the URL-encoded
value held by the `SiteURI` class, decodes it, and then checks that it
does not contain not permitted strings.

### [Adding Permitted Characters](#id5)[](#adding-permitted-characters "Link to this heading")

The permitted characters can be changed by `Config\App::$permittedURIChars`.

If you want to use Unicode for URI paths, modify it to allow the characters to
be used. For example, if you want to use Bengali, you will need to set the
following value in **app/Config/App.php**:

```
public string $permittedURIChars = 'a-z 0-9~%.:_\-\x{0980}-\x{09ff}';
```

A full list of Unicode ranges can be found at Wikipedia’s [Unicode block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_block).

## [Removing the index.php file](#id6)[](#removing-the-index-php-file "Link to this heading")

When you use Apache Web Server, by default, the **index.php** file will be needed in your URLs:

```
example.com/index.php/news/article/my_article
```

If your server supports rewriting URLs you can easily remove this file with URL rewriting. This is handled differently
by different servers, but we will show examples for the two most common web servers here.

### [Apache Web Server](#id7)[](#apache-web-server "Link to this heading")

Apache must have the *mod\_rewrite* extension enabled. If it does, you can use a `.htaccess` file with some simple rules.
Here is an example of such a file, using the “negative” method in which everything is redirected except the specified
items:

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L]
```

In this example, any HTTP request other than those for existing directories and existing files are treated as a
request for your index.php file.

Note

These specific rules might not work for all server configurations.

Note

Make sure to also exclude from the above rules any assets that you might need to be accessible from the outside world.

### [nginx](#id8)[](#nginx "Link to this heading")

Under nginx, you can define a location block and use the `try_files` directive to get the same effect as we did with
the above Apache configuration:

```
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
}
```

This will first look for a file or directory matching the URI (constructing the full path to each file from the
settings of the root and alias directives), and then sends the request to the index.php file along with any arguments.
