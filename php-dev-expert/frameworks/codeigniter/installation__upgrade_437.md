## [Breaking Changes](#id1)[](#breaking-changes "Link to this heading")

### [Feature Testing Request Body](#id2)[](#feature-testing-request-body "Link to this heading")

If you call:

1. [withBody()](testing__feature.md#feature-setting-the-body)
2. and [withBodyFormat()](testing__feature.md#feature-formatting-the-request)
3. and pass the `$params` to [call()](testing__feature.md#feature-requesting-a-page) (or shorthand methods)

the priority for a Request body has been changed. In the unlikely event that you
have test code affected by this change, modify it.

For example, now the `$params` is used to build the request body, and the `$body`
is not used:

```
$this->withBody($body)->withBodyFormat('json')->call('post', $params)
```

Previously, the `$body` was used for the request body.

### [Return value of Validation::loadRuleGroup()](#id3)[](#return-value-of-validation-loadrulegroup "Link to this heading")

The return value of `Validation::loadRuleGroup()` has been changed from
“**rules array**” to “**array** of **rules array** and **customErrors array**”
(`[rules, customErrors]`).

If you use the method, update the code like the following:

```
$rules = $this->validation->loadRuleGroup($rules);
    ↓
[$rules, $customErrors] = $this->validation->loadRuleGroup($rules);
```

## [Project Files](#id4)[](#project-files "Link to this heading")

Some files in the **project space** (root, app, public, writable) received updates. Due to
these files being outside of the **system** scope they will not be changed without your intervention.

There are some third-party CodeIgniter modules available to assist with merging changes to
the project space: [Explore on Packagist](https://packagist.org/explore/?query=codeigniter4%20updates).

### [Content Changes](#id5)[](#content-changes "Link to this heading")
