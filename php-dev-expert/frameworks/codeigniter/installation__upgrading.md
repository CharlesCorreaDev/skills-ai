# Upgrading From a Previous Version[](#upgrading-from-a-previous-version "Link to this heading")

Please read the upgrade notes corresponding to the version you are
upgrading from.

See also [Backward Compatibility Notes](installation__backward_compatibility_notes.md).

The manual mentions changes to **project space**. To perform the update,
you need to compare the original files from **vendor/codeigniter4/framework** or from the ZIP archive and make changes.

Example, the original **app/Config/App.php** will be located in **vendor/codeigniter4/framework/app/Config/App.php**.
Alternatively, replace it with a new file and add your previous lines.

Note

If you don’t know what version of CodeIgniter you are currently running,
you can get it from [the Debug Toolbar](testing__debugging.md#the-debug-toolbar),
or simply echo the constant `\CodeIgniter\CodeIgniter::CI_VERSION`.
