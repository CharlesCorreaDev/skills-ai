# Version 4.3.0[](#version-4-3-0 "Link to this heading")

Release Date: January 10, 2023

**4.3.0 release of CodeIgniter4**

## [Highlights](#id8)[](#highlights "Link to this heading")

- Query Builder supports **upsert()**, **upsertBatch()**, **deleteBatch()** and
  now **\*batch()** methods can set data from a query
  (*contributed by* [sclubricants](https://github.com/sclubricants)).
  See [Query Builder](#query-builder).
- Database Forge supports to **add indexes in the existing tables** and
  **name indexes** (*contributed by* [sclubricants](https://github.com/sclubricants)).
  See [Forge](#forge).
- To make the default configuration more secure, the default Validation Rules
  have been changed to **Strict Rules**.
- When a database error occurs, the conditions that an exception is thrown and
  the exception classes that can be thrown have been changed.
  See [Exceptions when Database Errors Occur](#exceptions-when-database-errors-occur).

## [BREAKING](#id9)[](#breaking "Link to this heading")

### [Behavior Changes](#id10)[](#behavior-changes "Link to this heading")

#### [Exceptions when Database Errors Occur](#id11)[](#exceptions-when-database-errors-occur "Link to this heading")

- The exceptions thrown by the database connection classes have been changed to `CodeIgniter\Database\Exceptions\DatabaseException`. Previously, different database drivers threw different exception classes, but these have been unified into `DatabaseException`.
- The exceptions thrown by the `execute()` method of Prepared Queries have been changed to `DatabaseException`. Previously, different database drivers might throw different exception classes or did not throw exceptions, but these have been unified into `DatabaseException`.
- During transactions, exceptions are not thrown by default even if `DBDebug` is true.
- `DBDebug` and `CI_DEBUG` Changes

  > - To be consistent in behavior regardless of environments, `Config\Database::$default['DBDebug']`
  >   and `Config\Database::$tests['DBDebug']` has been changed to `true` by default. With these
  >   settings, an exception is always thrown when a database error occurs. Previously, it is `false`
  >   **only in the production environment**.
  > - Now `DatabaseException` thrown in `BaseBuilder` is thrown if `$DBDebug` is true.
  >   Previously, it is thrown if `CI_DEBUG` is true.
  > - The default value of `BaseConnection::$DBDebug` has been changed to `true`.
  > - With these changes, `DBDebug` **now means whether or not to throw an exception when an error occurs**.
  >   Although unrelated to debugging, the name has not been changed.
  > - When running transactions with `DBDebug` is `true`, even if a query error occurs, exceptions
  >   are not thrown by default. Previously, if a query error occurs, all the queries
  >   will be rolled backed, and an exception will be thrown, so [Managing Errors](database__transactions.md#transactions-managing-errors) or
  >   [Running Transactions Manually](database__transactions.md#transactions-manual-transactions) won’t work.
  > - Now when you delete without WHERE clause in `Model`, `DatabaseException` is thrown even if
  >   `CI_DEBUG` is false. Previously, it is thrown if `CI_DEBUG` is true.

#### [HTTP Status Code and Exit Code when Exception Occurs](#id12)[](#http-status-code-and-exit-code-when-exception-occurs "Link to this heading")

Previously, CodeIgniter’s Exception Handler used the *Exception code* as the *HTTP status code* in some cases, and calculated the *Exit code* based on the Exception code. However there should be no logical connection with Exception code and HTTP Status Code or Exit code.

- Now the Exception Handler sets HTTP status code to `500` and set Exit code to the constant `EXIT_ERROR` (= `1`) by default.
- You can change HTTP status code or Exit code to implement `HTTPExceptionInterface` or `HasExitCodeInterface` in your Exception class. See [Specify HTTP Status Code in Your Exception](general__errors.md#error-specify-http-status-code) and [Specify Exit Code in Your Exception](general__errors.md#error-specify-exit-code).

For example, the Exit code has been changed like the following:

- If an uncaught `ConfigException` occurs, the Exit code is `EXIT_CONFIG` (= `3`) instead of `12`.
- If an uncaught `CastException` occurs, the Exit code is `EXIT_CONFIG` (= `3`) instead of `9`.
- If an uncaught `DatabaseException` occurs, the Exit code is `EXIT_DATABASE` (= `8`) instead of `17`.

#### [Time](#id13)[](#time "Link to this heading")

The following methods of the [Time](libraries__time.md) class had bugs that changed the state of the current object. To fix these bugs, the Time class has been fixed:

> - `add()`
> - `modify()`
> - `setDate()`
> - `setISODate()`
> - `setTime()`
> - `sub()`

- Now the `Time` class extends `DateTimeImmutable` and is completely immutable.
- `TimeLegacy` class has been added for backward compatibility, which behaves the same as the unmodified `Time` class.

#### [Others](#id14)[](#others "Link to this heading")

- **Helper:** [`script_tag()`](helpers__html_helper.md#script_tag "script_tag") and [`safe_mailto()`](helpers__url_helper.md#safe_mailto "safe_mailto") no longer output `type="text/javascript"` in `<script>` tag.
- **CLI:** The `spark` file has been changed due to a change in the processing of Spark commands.
- **CLI:** `CITestStreamFilter::$buffer = ''` no longer causes the filter to be registered to listen for streams. Now there
  is a `CITestStreamFilter::registration()` method for this. See [Capturing STDERR and STDOUT streams in Tests](installation__upgrade_430.md#upgrade-430-stream-filter) for details.
- **Database:** `InvalidArgumentException` that is a kind of `LogicException` in `BaseBuilder::_whereIn()` is not suppressed by the configuration. Previously if `CI_DEBUG` was false, the exception was suppressed.
- **Database:** The data structure returned by [BaseConnection::getForeignKeyData()](database__metadata.md#metadata-getforeignkeydata) has been changed.
- **Database:** `CodeIgniter\Database\BasePreparedQuery` class returns now a bool value for write-type queries instead of the `Result` class object.
- **Model:** `Model::update()` method now raises a `DatabaseException` if it generates an SQL
  statement without a WHERE clause; Model does not support operations that update all records.
- **Routing:** `RouteCollection::resetRoutes()` resets Auto-Discovery of Routes. Previously once discovered, RouteCollection never discover Routes files again even if `RouteCollection::resetRoutes()` is called.

### [Interface Changes](#id15)[](#interface-changes "Link to this heading")
