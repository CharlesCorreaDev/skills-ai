## [Breaking Changes](#id1)[](#breaking-changes "Link to this heading")

### [Time::createFromTimestamp() Timezone Change](#id2)[](#time-createfromtimestamp-timezone-change "Link to this heading")

When you do not specify a timezone, now
[Time::createFromTimestamp()](libraries__time.md#time-createfromtimestamp) returns a Time
instance with the app’s timezone is returned.

If you want to keep the timezone UTC, you need to call `setTimezone('UTC')`:

```
use CodeIgniter\I18n\Time;

$time = Time::createFromTimestamp(1501821586)->setTimezone('UTC');
```

the project space: [Explore on Packagist](https://packagist.org/explore/?query=codeigniter4%20updates).
