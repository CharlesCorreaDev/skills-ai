## [Mandatory File Changes](#id1)[](#mandatory-file-changes "Link to this heading")

### [Worker Mode](#id2)[](#worker-mode "Link to this heading")

upgrading. The easiest way is to re-run the install command:

```
php spark worker:install --force
```

## [Breaking Changes](#id3)[](#breaking-changes "Link to this heading")

### [File Validation](#id4)[](#file-validation "Link to this heading")

The `ext_in` file upload validation rule now checks the client filename
extension and verifies that the detected MIME type is associated with that
extension. Previously, `ext_in` only checked the MIME-derived guessed
extension.

This means files with no client filename extension, or files whose client
filename extension does not match the detected MIME type, now fail `ext_in`
validation. If your application intentionally accepts such files, remove
`ext_in` from those validation rules and use a custom validation rule that
matches your application’s requirements.

## [Project Files](#id5)[](#project-files "Link to this heading")

Some files in the **project space** (root, app, public, writable) received updates. Due to
these files being outside of the **system** scope they will not be changed without your intervention.

Note

There are some third-party CodeIgniter modules available to assist
with merging changes to the project space:
[Explore on Packagist](https://packagist.org/explore/?query=codeigniter4%20updates).

### [Content Changes](#id6)[](#content-changes "Link to this heading")

- app/Config/Routes.php
- app/Config/View.php

### [All Changes](#id7)[](#all-changes "Link to this heading")
