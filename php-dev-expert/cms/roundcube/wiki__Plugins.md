## Activating Plugins

A plugin is not loaded until you enable it by adding its directory name to the config option `plugins`, as an array element. This is done by editing your local `config/config.inc.php` file.

For example, to enable plugins named `additional_message_headers` and `archive`, `config/config.inc.php` should contain this line:

```
    $config['plugins'] = array('additional_message_headers', 'archive');
```

To disable a plugin, just remove it from the list.
