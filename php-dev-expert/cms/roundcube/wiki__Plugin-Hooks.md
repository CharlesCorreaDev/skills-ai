## Template Hooks

The RoundCube skin retrieves certain parts (e.g. message list, folders list, etc.) from the application with special tags within the HTML templates: `<roundcube:object name="someobject" ... />`. Template hooks are triggered once a template object is rendered. A plugin can alter or extend the html content of a template object.

The hooks are named `template_object_*` where \* is the name of the object. A list of all available template objects is given in [wiki:Doc\_SkinML#Contentobjects].

*Arguments:*

- content
- [*tag attributes*]

*Return values:*

- content

### template\_container

Allows a plugin the add HTML content to a specific container.
A skin template may specify several containers (e.g. taskbar, toolbar, etc...). This hook is triggered when the template engine processes such a container and it is also internally used for adding buttons using `$this->add_button(attrib, container)`. Remember to always add or prepend to the `content` argument and never replace it entirely.

*Arguments:*

- name: *Name of the container*
- content: *The container content*

*Return values:*

- content

### render\_page

Triggered after a template was parsed, just before sending the HTML page to the client.
This is the place where plugins can add additional content to the page which is not related to any template object. Use `$rcmail->output->add_footer()` or `$this->include_script()` to extend the html page. Of course it's also possible to directly alter the `content` attribute.

*Arguments:*

- template: *Name of the rendred template*
- content: *The HTML source*

*Return values:*

- content

### send\_page

(since 0.6-beta)

The final HTML code of a page is passed to this hook before delivering it to the browser.
Final string-based modifications on the content can be made here.

*Arguments:*

- content: *The HTML source*

*Return values:*

- content

### render\_response

(since 1.0-beta)

This is the *render\_page* equivalent for AJAX calls and the final opportunity for plugins to append
or modify the server response to the client.

*Arguments:*

- response: *The full response data structure before being serialized to json*

*Return values:*

- response
