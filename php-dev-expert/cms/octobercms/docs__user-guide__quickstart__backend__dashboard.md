# Dashboard & Statistics

Customize your dashboard and generate some statistics

- [Edit the Dashboard](docs__user-guide__quickstart__backend__dashboard.md#edit-the-dashboard)
- [Remove a Widget](docs__user-guide__quickstart__backend__dashboard.md#remove-a-widget)
- [Reset the Layout](docs__user-guide__quickstart__backend__dashboard.md#reset-the-layout)

- [Next Steps](docs__user-guide__quickstart__backend__dashboard.md#next-steps)

The dashboard is the first thing you see after logging in. Right now it shows a couple of default widgets. Let's make it your own and give it some real data to display.

## [#](#edit-the-dashboard) Edit the Dashboard

The dashboard ships with a **Welcome** widget and a **System status** widget. To make changes, you first switch the dashboard into edit mode:

1. Click the pencil icon next to the dashboard name and select **Edit Dashboard** from the menu.
2. The dashboard enters edit mode, where you can add, configure, move, and remove widgets.

Try rearranging the widgets by dragging one to a new position. You can also click **Add Widget** in a row to add a new widget, or **Add Row** to start a new row.

## [#](#remove-a-widget) Remove a Widget

Let's clean up by removing the Welcome widget. You won't need it once you know your way around.

1. While in edit mode, click the menu icon on the **Welcome** widget.
2. Select **Delete** from the menu.

The widget disappears. Don't worry, removing a widget doesn't delete any data, it just hides the panel.

## [#](#reset-the-layout) Reset the Layout

Changed your mind? You can always start over.

1. Click the pencil icon next to the dashboard name.
2. Select **Reset Layout** from the menu.
3. Confirm. Your dashboard returns to the default layout with all the original widgets restored.

Each administrator has their own independent dashboard layout. Resetting yours won't affect what other admins see.

## [#](#add-traffic-statistics) Add Traffic Statistics

October CMS includes a built-in statistics plugin that tracks page views. Let's turn it on and generate some sample data.

1. Navigate to **Settings → Internal Traffic Statistics** in the main menu.
2. Click the **Generate Data** button to create some sample traffic data. This fills the statistics widget with fake page views so you can see how it looks.
3. Go back to the **Dashboard** by clicking the Dashboard link in the top menu.

You should now see a traffic chart on your dashboard. If it doesn't appear automatically, enter edit mode, click **Add Widget**, and choose the **Traffic Information** data source.

In production, this plugin tracks real visitor traffic automatically, no fake data needed. The statistics you generated here are just for exploring the dashboard during this tutorial.

## [#](#next-steps) Next Steps

Your dashboard is set up. Next, let's create another administrator account and explore roles. Continue to [Managing Administrators](docs__user-guide__quickstart__backend__managing-admins.md).
