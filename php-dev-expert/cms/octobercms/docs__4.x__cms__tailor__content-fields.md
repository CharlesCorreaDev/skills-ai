# Content Fields

Get started by defining form fields for your content.

- [List and Filter Properties](docs__4.x__cms__tailor__content-fields.md#list-and-filter-properties)
- [Field Configuration](#field-configuration)
- [External Configuration](#external-configuration)
- [Form Field Validation](docs__4.x__cms__tailor__content-fields.md#form-field-validation)
- [Modifying Core Fields](docs__4.x__cms__tailor__content-fields.md#modifying-core-fields)

You may build custom content fields by [extending tailor](docs__4.x__extend__tailor-fields.md).

Content Fields are the cornerstone of the Tailor module and define how a field should be configured and displayed. These definitions are often found under the **fields** property of a blueprint.

```
fields:
    name:
        label: Full Name
        type: text
```

A complete list of available fields can be found in the [Backend Elements section](docs__4.x__element__form-fields.md).

For each field you can specify these common properties, where applicable.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **label** | a name when displaying the form field to the user. |
| **shortLabel** | a shorter label to use in lists and filters. |
| **type** | defines how this field should be rendered, see [form field definitions](docs__4.x__element__form-fields.md). Default: text. |
| **span** | aligns the form field to one side. Options: auto, left, right, row, full, adaptive. Default: `full`. |
| **spanClass** | used with the span `row` option to display the form as a Bootstrap grid, for example, `spanClass: col-4`. |
| **size** | specifies a field size for fields that use it, for example, the textarea field. |
| **placeholder** | if the field supports a placeholder value. |
| **comment** | places a descriptive comment below the field. |
| **commentAbove** | places a comment above the field. |
| **commentHtml** | allow HTML markup inside the comment. Default: `false`. |
| **default** | specify the default value for the field. For `dropdown`, `checkboxlist`, `radio` and `balloon-selector` widgets, you may specify an option key here to have it selected by default. |
| **tab** | assigns the field to a tab. |
| **validation** | defines validation rules for the form field, see [the validation article](docs__4.x__extend__services__validation.md) for rule definitions. |
| **trigger** | specify conditions for this field using [trigger events](docs__4.x__element__form-fields.md). |
| **preset** | allows the field value to be initially set by the value of another field, converted using the [input preset converter](docs__4.x__element__form-fields.md). |
| **translatable** | disables translation for this field when using the `multisite` in the blueprint definition. For repeater fields, set to `sync` to keep the repeater structure synced across sites while allowing sub-fields to be translated independently, see [Translatable Repeaters](docs__4.x__element__form__widget-repeater.md). |

## [#](#list-and-filter-properties) List and Filter Properties

When it comes to displaying a field in a list or filter, each field has its own default settings. You may override these settings on a per field basis and this is suitable for minor adjustments. For more complex use cases, we recommend defining columns and scopes separately from the fields (see below).

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **column** | defines how to display the field in a list, see [list column definitions](docs__4.x__element__list-columns.md). |
| **scope** | defines how to display the field in a filter, see [filter scope definitions](docs__4.x__element__filter-scopes.md). |

### [#](#field-configuration) Field Configuration

An example can be specifying a different label for each using the `column` or `scope` properties of the field.

```
myfield:
    label: Form Label
    column:
        label: List Label
    scope:
        label: Filter Label
```

If the are set to `false` then the field will disable and prevent it from being displayed.

```
myfield:
    label: Form Label
    column: false
    scope: false
```

The `column` type can be set to `invisible` to make it hidden from the list by default.

```
myfield:
    label: Form Label
    column: invisible
```

### [#](#external-configuration) External Configuration

You may define the scopes and columns separately from the form fields by using the `columns` and `scopes` property in the blueprint. When using external configuration, the default view will be replaced by only the defined fields.

```
scopes:
    myfield:
        label: Filter Label
        # [...]

columns:
    myfield:
        label: List Label
        # [...]

fields:
    myfield:
        label: Form Label
        # [...]
```

A **fields** definition must exist for a **columns** or **scopes** definition to be valid. To hide the definition from the form, use `hidden: true` to hide it from the form, and then `hidden: false` to display it in the column or scope.

List columns have short-hand values that can be used. Passing a string will replace the label, passing `true` will include the default column, passing `false` will remove the column and passing `invisible` will make the column invisible.

```
columns:
    myfield: List Label   # New Label
    myfield: true         # Shown
    myfield: false        # Hidden
    myfield: invisible    # Invisible
    myfield: [...]        # Config Array
```

Filter scopes have a similar short-hand values to the list columns that can be used.

```
scopes:
    myfield: Filter Label # New Label
    myfield: true         # Shown
    myfield: false        # Hidden
    myfield: [...]        # Config Array
```

## [#](#form-field-validation) Form Field Validation

You may specify validation rules for form fields using the `validation` field property, see [the validation article](docs__4.x__extend__services__validation.md) for rule definitions.

```
fields:
    myfield:
        label: Featured Text
        validation: "required|min:15"
```

Validation rules can also be defined externally in the blueprint file using the `validation` blueprint property. This allows you to set custom attribute names and validation messages.

```
validation:
    rules:
        myfield: "required|min:15"
    attributeNames:
        myfield: My Field
    customMessages:
        myfield.min: "My field has to be at least 15 characters long"

fields:
    myfield:
        label: Form Label
        # [...]
```

The `unique` validation rule is automatically configured and does not require a table name to be specified.

```
unique_field:
    label: Unique Field
    validation: unique
```

The `required` validation rule supports **create** and **update** modifiers to only apply when a model is created or updated respectively. The following is only required when the model does not already exist.

```
password:
    label: Password
    validation: "required:create"
```

## [#](#modifying-core-fields) Modifying Core Fields

Each blueprint record has several core fields as [defined by attributes on the model](docs__4.x__cms__tailor__models.md). You can modify these fields under certain conditions.

An Entry is enabled by default; however, you can modify this by specifying a new default value for the `is_enabled` field.

```
fields:
    is_enabled:
        default: false
```

The `title` field placeholder is generated based on the blueprint name; however, you can customize this to something more useful depending on the use case. For example, *First and Last Name*, *Event Title* or *Location Name*.

```
fields:
    title:
        placeholder: Event Title
```

In some cases the `title` field may not be required, such as using a [single blueprint](docs__4.x__cms__tailor__blueprints.md),you may set the `hidden` property to `true`. Hiding the title will disable the in-built validation for this field.

```
fields:
    title:
        hidden: true
```
