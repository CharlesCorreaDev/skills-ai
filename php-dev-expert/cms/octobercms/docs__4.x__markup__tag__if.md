Twig Tag

- [Expression Rules](docs__4.x__markup__tag__if.md#expression-rules)

The `{% if %}` and `{% endif %}` tags will represent an expression and is comparable with the if statements of PHP. In the simplest form you can use it to test if an expression evaluates to `true`:

```
___TWIG0___
    <p>The website is in maintenance mode.</p>
___TWIG1___
```

You can also test if an array is not empty:

```
___TWIG0___
    <ul>
        ___TWIG1___
            <li>___TWIG2___</li>
        ___TWIG3___
    </ul>
___TWIG4___
```

> **Note**: If you want to test if the variable is defined, use `{% if users is defined %}` instead.

You can also use `not` to check for values that evaluate to `false`:

```
___TWIG0___
    <p>You are not subscribed to our mailing list.</p>
___TWIG1___
```

For multiple expressions `{% elseif %}` and `{% else %}` can be used:

```
___TWIG0___
    Kenny is sick.
___TWIG1___
    You killed Kenny! You bastard!!!
___TWIG2___
    Kenny looks okay so far.
___TWIG3___
```
