The ticket list page is the main dashboard for users to see all their submitted support tickets. It shows the ticket ID, subject, status, and creation date, with a link to submit new tickets.

## [#](#creating-the-ticket-list-page) Creating the Ticket List Page

Create a new page at `pages/support/tickets.htm`:

```
title = "Support Tickets"
url = "/support"
layout = "default"

[supportTickets]
submitPage = "support/submit"
ticketPage = "support/ticket"

[session]
security = "user"
redirect = "account/login"
```

```
<div class="flex items-center justify-between mb-6">
    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">
        My Tickets

## [#](#how-this-page-works) How This Page Works

The `[session]` component with `security = "user"` requires the visitor to be logged in. If they are not, they are redirected to the login page.

The `supportTickets` component provides the `tickets` variable, a paginated collection of the logged-in user's tickets sorted by newest first. Each ticket has a `url` property that links to the ticket detail page (set by the `ticketPage` property).

The `has_new` property is true when the last message on the ticket was from support staff, indicating there is a response the user has not seen yet. The blue dot makes these tickets easy to spot.

## [#](#try-it-out) Try It Out

1. Navigate to `/support` while logged in
2. The list should be empty since no tickets exist yet
3. The "Submit a new ticket" button links to the submission page, which you will create next

## [#](#next-steps) Next Steps

Continue to [Submit Ticket](docs__user-guide__helpdesk__submit-ticket.md) to create the ticket submission form.
