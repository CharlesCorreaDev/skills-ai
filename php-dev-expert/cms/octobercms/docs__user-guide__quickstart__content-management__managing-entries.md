# Managing Entries

Customize the navigation, add team members, and manage your content

Your blueprints are created and the database is set up. Now let's customize how the content type appears in the backend, then add some team members.

## [#](#reassign-the-navigation) Reassign the Navigation

By default, new blueprints appear under the **Content** menu. Let's give Team Members their own top-level navigation item with a custom label and icon.

1. Open your team member blueprint at `themes/mytheme/blueprints/team/member.yaml`.
2. Add a `navigation` section below the `name` field:

```
handle: Team\Member
type: entry
name: Team Member

navigation:
    label: Our Team
    icon: ph ph-users
    order: 200
```

3. Save the file.
4. Refresh the backend. You should now see **Our Team** in the top navigation with a users icon.

October CMS uses the [Font Awesome 4  (opens new window)](https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/) icon set. Browse the icons to find one that fits your content type. Common choices: `icon-pencil` for blog posts, `icon-calendar` for events, `icon-shopping-cart` for products.

## [#](#add-your-first-team-member) Add Your First Team Member

1. Click **Our Team** in the navigation.
2. Click the **Create** button.
3. Fill in the fields:
   - **Title**: `Ada Lovelace`
   - **Role**: `Lead Engineer`
   - **Email**: `ada@example.com`
   - **Photo**: upload any image (or skip this for now)
   - **Bio**: `Pioneer of computer programming and mathematical genius.`
4. Click **Save**.

Your first team member is created and appears in the list.

## [#](#duplicate-and-add-more-members) Duplicate and Add More Members

Instead of filling out the form from scratch each time, you can duplicate an existing entry.

1. Open **Ada Lovelace** from the list.
2. Click the **Duplicate** button (or find it in the toolbar menu).
3. A copy is created. Update the fields:
   - **Title**: `Grace Hopper`
   - **Role**: `Systems Architect`
   - **Email**: `grace@example.com`
   - **Bio**: `Invented the first compiler and popularized machine-independent programming languages.`
4. Click **Save**.

Repeat to add a few more team members. Here are some suggestions:

- **Alan Turing**: `Research Scientist`, `Laid the foundation for modern computing and artificial intelligence.`
- **Margaret Hamilton**: `Software Director`, `Led the team that wrote the onboard flight software for NASA's Apollo missions.`
- **Linus Torvalds**: `Open Source Lead`, `Created Linux and Git, two pillars of modern software development.`

Add as many or as few as you like. We will use these entries when building the frontend.

## [#](#configure-the-team-settings) Configure the Team Settings

1. Navigate to the **Team Settings** global. You will find it under **Content** in the navigation (or wherever Tailor placed it).
2. Fill in the settings:
   - **Page Title**: `Meet the Team`
   - **Introduction**: `The people behind the project. Each one brings something unique to the table.`
   - **Show Profile Photos**: leave it toggled **on**
   - **Members Per Page**: set to `2` (we are using a small number so you can see pagination in action)
3. Click **Save**.

These settings will control the frontend display when we build the team page in the next article.

## [#](#next-steps) Next Steps

You have team members in the system and settings configured. Continue to [Building the Frontend](docs__user-guide__quickstart__content-management__building-the-frontend.md) to create a team listing page and individual profile pages that display this content.
