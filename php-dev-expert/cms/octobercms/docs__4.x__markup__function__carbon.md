# carbon()

Twig Function

- [format](docs__4.x__markup__function__carbon.md#format)
- [isoFormat](docs__4.x__markup__function__carbon.md#isoformat)
- [diffForHumans](docs__4.x__markup__function__carbon.md#diffforhumans)
- [Cache Busting URLs](docs__4.x__markup__function__carbon.md#cache-busting-urls)
- [Date Format Cheat Sheet](docs__4.x__markup__function__carbon.md#date-format-cheat-sheet)

The `carbon()` function can be used to handle dates and times using Twig, prepared with a [Carbon object  (opens new window)](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/) and all its available functions.

The supplied value will be automatically converted to the current timezone depending on the `cms.timezone` configuration setting, which can be set using a [site definition](docs__4.x__cms__multisite__multisite.md).

To output the current date time value:

```
___TWIG0___
```

To specify a custom value:

```
{{ carbon('2024-01-01 02:13:23') }}
```

## [#](#format) format

The `format` method can be used to apply various formats.

```
Meeting starts at ___TWIG0___ in Johannesburg.
```

## [#](#isoformat) isoFormat

Formats a date or time according to locale settings using ISO standards. This replaces the deprecated `formatLocalized` method.

```
___TWIG0___
```

For example, to display the month and year in French:

```
___TWIG0___  ___TWIG1___
```

## [#](#diffforhumans) diffForHumans

The `diffForHumans` method will render the difference between a date and now in human readible text.

```
___TWIG0___
```

## [#](#cache-busting-urls) Cache Busting URLs

You can use the format to produce cache busting URLs.

```
// Outputs: 10.26.22.22.53.31
carbon('now').format('m.d.y.H.i.s')
```

Then build the URL like the following.

```
<img src="___TWIG0___?___TWIG1___" alt="" />
```
