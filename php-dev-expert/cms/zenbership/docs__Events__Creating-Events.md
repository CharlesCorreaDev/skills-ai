Timeline Tab

Forms Tab

Media Tab

## Timeline Tab

The timeline tab allows you to build a "schedule of events" for the event. Essentially, it allows you to give your attendees a schedule of what is happening at the event, the location that item is happening at, and the start/end date/time for each timeline entry.

## Forms Tab

This section allows you to build both a primary registrant's registration form and a guest registration form. Please [click here](docs__Integration__Form-Builder.md) for information on the form builder.

## Media Tab

This tab allows you to upload both cover photos and additional photos for the event. Cover photos appear at the top of the event's page (see below). If you upload multiple cover photos, the program will create an automatically rotating slide show of the images.

Additional photos appear on the events details page next to the event description.

You can crop and edit any image by clicking on the "Files" tab within the event management page. [Click here](docs__Tutorials__Cropping-and-Editing-Images.md) for information on cropping and manipulating images.

Here is an example of how the above event would appear to a user once rendered online. The page itself is rendered through the template system using the following templates:

**Primary Template**

- "Viewing Event": Wrapper template into which all sub-templates are rendered. Sub-templates replace the %wrapper\_content% caller tag on this template.

**Sub-Templates**

- "Event Details": The "Overview" page for the event, as pictured below.
- "Event Timeline"
- "Event Register Pricing Options"

**Registration Process**

- "Event Registration Form"

- "Event Register Guests Form"
- "Event Registration Confirmed"
