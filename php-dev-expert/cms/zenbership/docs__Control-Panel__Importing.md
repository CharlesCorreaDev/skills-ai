# Importing

## Overview

Importing allows you to create, edit, or delete contacts and members using a properly formatted CSV (comma separated values) file.

## CSV File

Every import is built around a properly formatted CSV file. When creating a CSV file, you will need to follow these conventions:

- Each field that you are importing needs to be "delimited" (separated) by either a comma or a tab character.
- Data should not take up more than a single line. That means that each line after the first line represents one contact or one member.
- The first line should contain the proper "Display Name" or "Caller Tag" of the field you are importing. You can find this information from the "Integration > Fields" page of the administrative dashboard:

You must use the exact display name or caller tag when creating the first line of your CSV file.

- If a "value" for a field contains a comma, you need to enclose the value in quotes.
- The number of values in each line must match the number of fields on the first line of the CSV file.

### Example CSV File

```
username,first_name,last_name,email,company_name,occupation,address_line_1,twitter,city
johndoe,John,Doe,john@doe.com,"Acme, Inc",Lead Developer,100 S State St,http://twitter.com/ascadnetworks,Chicago
janedoe,Jane,Doe,jane@doe.com,Ascad Networks,VP of Sales,272 Broadway St,,New York
```

The above CSV file, when imported, would create two new members, one with username "johndoe", another with username "janedoe".

- Notice how the company name for user "johndoe" contains a comma. Because of this, to not confuse the program, you must enclosed it quotes: "Acme, Inc".
- You can leave a value blank, but you still need to include in on the file. Notice how for "janedoe", the Twitter URL is not available, therefore a empty space is found between the address and city.

### Using Spreadsheet Software

The easiest way to create a properly formatted CSV file is to use spreadsheet software such as [OpenOffice Calc](http://www.openoffice.org/product/calc.html), [Microsoft Excel](http://office.microsoft.com/en–us/excel/), or [Google Docs Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/).
