  - [Available Actions](commerce_5x__reference__controller-actions.md#available-actions)

Commerce exposes a number of common resources to your storefront via an HTTP API.

We recommend reviewing the main Craft documentation on [forms and controller actions](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/development/forms) before you dig in, here!

Starts a new subscription with the current customer’s default payment source. Learn more about supporting [Subscriptions](commerce_5x__system__subscriptions.md).

```
{% set currentPlan = subscription.getPlan() %}
{% set gateway = currentPlan.getGateway() %}
{% set allPlans = craft.commerce.plans.getPlansByGatewayId(gateway.id) %}
{% set switchablePlans = allPlans|filter((p) => p.canSwitchFrom(currentPlan)) %}

<select name="planUid">
  {% for plan in switchablePlans %}
