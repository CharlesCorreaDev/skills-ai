Range fields give you a [range input  (opens new window)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range) that allows authors to set a number using a visual slider or a number input.

Adding a new range field via the control panel.

Range fields have the following settings:

- **Min Value** — The *lowest* number that may be accessed using the slider or entered manually.
- **Max Value** — The *highest* number that may be accessed using the slider or entered manually.
- **Step Size** — The permitted granularity, mapped to the [`step`  (opens new window)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number#step) attribute of the resulting `range` and `number` inputs.
- **Default Value** — An initial value for the input, on new elements.
- **Suffix Text** — A string to include after the number input.

Working with range field values is identical to [number fields](docs_5x__reference__field-types__number.md).
