Craft supports user-managed, hierarchical taxonomies for content via **categories**.

Categories are one of Craft’s built-in [element types](docs_5x__system__elements.md), and are represented throughout the application as instances of [craft\elements\Category  (opens new window)](https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v5/craft-elements-category.html).

Migrating to Structures

With the release of Craft 4.4, we began consolidating features of [other element types](docs_5x__system__elements.md) into [entries](docs_5x__reference__element-types__entries.md).

As part of that process, we introduced a [console command](docs_5x__reference__cli.md#entrify-categories) that can automate the conversion of categories to [structure sections](docs_5x__reference__element-types__entries.md#structures):

```
php craft entrify/categories myCategoryGroupHandle
```

Read more about this [transition  (opens new window)](https://craftcms.com/blog/entrification) on our blog.

## [#](#category-groups)Category Groups

Every category belongs to a *category group*, which defines…

- …a name;
- …a handle (used when referencing the group in [queries](#querying-categories) and templates);
- …the maximum number of levels categories can be nested, within the group;
- …the format of category URIs used for [routing](#routing-and-templates);
- …which [template](#routing-and-templates) should be rendered when a category’s URL is accessed;
- …which [fields](docs_5x__system__fields.md) categories in the group should have;

To create a new category group, go to

1. Settings→
2. Categories

and click **New Category Group**.

## [#](#category-field-layout)Category Field Layout

Each category group has its own *field layout*, which allows you to customize the data that’s associated with each category in the group. By default, categories only have a **Title** and **Slug**, but you can add as many other [custom fields](docs_5x__system__fields.md) as necessary to satisfy your content architecture.

[Custom Fields

Craft’s powerful content features are driven by custom fields.](docs_5x__system__fields.md)

## [#](#creating-and-editing-categories)Creating and Editing Categories

When you’ve defined at least one category group, **Categories** will appear in the control panel’s primary navigation. Clicking it will take you to the category index. From there, you can choose a category group 1 from the sidebar, and add/reorder/delete categories within it:

my-craft-project.ddev.site/admin/categories/flavors

Select the “Structure” 2 sort option to view and manipulate the categories’ [hierarchy](docs_5x__system__elements.md#structures). Double-click any element 3 to open a [slideout](docs_5x__system__control-panel.md#slideouts).

You can also click a category’s title to visit its edit page just like an entry.

When you create a category, you have the following options:

- Fill out the category fields (if you didn’t define any, the only field available will be **Title**)
- Edit the slug (it’s automatically populated based on the title).
- Choose a **Parent** category. The new category will have a hierarchical relationship with its parent. This is helpful for creating taxonomies with multiple levels. You also have the option of creating a new category while assigning the Parent.

You can only nest categories up to the level specified in the **Max Level** field Category Group settings. By default, there is no limit to how deeply-nested categories can be.

## [#](#assigning-categories)Assigning Categories

To assign categories to things (entries, assets, users, etc.), you must first create a [categories field](docs_5x__reference__field-types__categories.md).

Each Categories field is connected to a single category group. Whatever you attach the field to will store [relations](docs_5x__system__relations.md) to categories selected from that group.

## [#](#routing-and-templates)Routing and Templates

Category groups’ **URI Format** setting is equivalent to that of [entries](docs_5x__reference__element-types__entries.md), so any of the [object template](docs_5x__system__object-templates.md) strategies discussed in [this section](docs_5x__reference__element-types__entries.md#entry-uri-formats) apply to categories, as well.

When a category’s URL is requested, Craft renders the template defined by its group, and makes a special `category` variable available. Supposing a *Flavors* category group had a **URI Format** of `flavors/{slug}` and was configured to use `_categories/flavors.twig` as its **Template**:

```
{{ category.title }}
{# -> "Sour Aromatics" #}

{{ category.ancestors.collect()
  .select('title')
  .join(' / ') }}
{# -> "Sour & Fermented / Sour" #}
```

Custom fields attached to the group’s field layout are also available via the `category` variable.

## [#](#querying-categories)Querying Categories

You can fetch categories in your templates or PHP code using **category queries**.

TwigPHP

```
{# Create a new category query #}
{% set myCategoryQuery = craft.categories() %}
```

```
// Create a new category query
$myCategoryQuery = \craft\elements\Category::find();
```

Once you’ve created a category query, you can set [parameters](#parameters) on it to narrow down the results, and then [execute it](docs_5x__development__element-queries.md#executing-element-queries) by calling `.all()`. An array of [Category  (opens new window)](https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v5/craft-elements-category.html) objects will be returned.

[Element Queries
→

Learn more about element queries.](docs_5x__development__element-queries.md)

### [#](#example)Example

We can display a navigation for all the categories in a *Flavors* category group by doing the following:

1. Create a category query with `craft.categories()`.
2. Set the [group](#group) parameter on it using its handle.
3. Fetch the categories with `.all()`.
4. Loop through the categories using a [nav](docs_5x__reference__twig__tags.md#nav) tag to create the navigation HTML.

```
{# Create a category query with the 'group' parameter #}
{% set myCategoryQuery = craft.categories()
  .group('flavors') %}

{# Fetch the categories #}
{% set categories = myCategoryQuery.all() %}

{# Display the navigation #}
<ul>
  {% nav category in categories %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ category.url }}">{{ category.title }}</a>
      {% ifchildren %}
        <ul>
          {% children %}
        </ul>
      {% endifchildren %}
    </li>
  {% endnav %}
</ul>
```

Keep in mind that this only holds value for category groups with multiple hierarchical levels. If you were working with a “flat” taxonomy, the template above should use a regular `{% for %}` tag in lieu of Craft’s `{% nav %}` tag.

To maintain the exact order you see in the control panel, add `orderBy('lft ASC')` to your query:

```
{% set myCategoryQuery = craft.categories()
  .group('flavors')
  .orderBy('lft ASC') %}
```

### [#](#elements-related-to-a-category)Elements Related to a Category

When you’ve attached a [categories field](docs_5x__reference__field-types__categories.md) to another type of element, you can query for those elements when you have a reference to a category.

For example, if we were building a “Tasting Notes” database with dedicated *Flavor* (category) pages, we might build a query like this to look up records:

```
{% set records = craft.entries()
  .relatedTo({
    targetElement: category,
    field: 'flavors',
  })
  .all() %}
```

Here, `flavors` also happens to be the handle of the relational field. *You do not need to follow any kind of convention when naming relational fields*; the groups available for selection in a given categories field are explicitly defined on that field.

[Relations
→

Read about querying with relational fields.](docs_5x__system__relations.md)

You can also use the field’s query method to set up the relational constraint, automatically:

```
{% set records = craft.entries()
  .flavors(category)
  .all() %}
```

In both cases, we’re assuming the `category` variable comes from Craft, when loading an individual category’s [template](#routing-and-templates).

Narrows the query results to only categories that have been soft-deleted.

TwigPHP

```
{# Fetch trashed categories #}
{% set categories = craft.categories()
  .trashed()
  .all() %}
```

```
// Fetch trashed categories
$categories = \craft\elements\Category::find()
    ->trashed()
    ->all();
```

#### [#](#uid)`uid`

[Defined by `craft\elements\db\ElementQuery`](https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v5/craft-elements-db-elementquery.html#method-uid)

Narrows the query results based on the categories’ UIDs.

TwigPHP

```
{# Fetch the category by its UID #}
{% set category = craft.categories()
  .uid('xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx')
  .one() %}
```

```
// Fetch the category by its UID
$category = \craft\elements\Category::find()
    ->uid('xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx')
    ->one();
```

#### [#](#unique)`unique`

[Defined by `craft\elements\db\ElementQuery`](https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v5/craft-elements-db-elementquery.html#method-unique)

Determines whether only elements with unique IDs should be returned by the query.

This should be used when querying elements from multiple sites at the same time, if “duplicate” results is not
desired.

TwigPHP

```
{# Fetch unique categories across all sites #}
{% set categories = craft.categories()
  .site('*')
  .unique()
  .all() %}
```

```
// Fetch unique categories across all sites
$categories = \craft\elements\Category::find()
    ->site('*')
    ->unique()
    ->all();
```

#### [#](#uri)`uri`

[Defined by `craft\elements\db\ElementQuery`](https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v5/craft-elements-db-elementquery.html#method-uri)

Narrows the query results based on the categories’ URIs.

Possible values include:

| Value | Fetches categories… |
| --- | --- |
| `'foo'` | with a URI of `foo`. |
| `'foo*'` | with a URI that begins with `foo`. |
| `'*foo'` | with a URI that ends with `foo`. |
| `'*foo*'` | with a URI that contains `foo`. |
| `'not *foo*'` | with a URI that doesn’t contain `foo`. |
| `['*foo*', '*bar*']` | with a URI that contains `foo` or `bar`. |
| `['not', '*foo*', '*bar*']` | with a URI that doesn’t contain `foo` or `bar`. |

TwigPHP

```
{# Get the requested URI #}
{% set requestedUri = craft.app.request.getPathInfo() %}

{# Fetch the category with that URI #}
{% set category = craft.categories()
  .uri(requestedUri|literal)
  .one() %}
```

```
// Get the requested URI
$requestedUri = \Craft::$app->request->getPathInfo();

// Fetch the category with that URI
$category = \craft\elements\Category::find()
    ->uri(\craft\helpers\Db::escapeParam($requestedUri))
    ->one();
```

#### [#](#wascounteagerloaded)`wasCountEagerLoaded`

[Defined by `craft\elements\db\ElementQuery`](https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v5/craft-elements-db-elementquery.html#method-wascounteagerloaded)

Returns whether the query result count was already eager loaded by the query's source element.

TwigPHP

```
{# Fetch categories eager-loaded with the "Related" field’s relations #}
{% set categories = craft.categories()
  .with(['related'])
  .all() %}
```
