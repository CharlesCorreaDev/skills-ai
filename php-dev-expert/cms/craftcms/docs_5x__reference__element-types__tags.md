# Tags

- ### On this Page

  - [Tag Groups](docs_5x__reference__element-types__tags.md#tag-groups)
  - [Assigning Tags](docs_5x__reference__element-types__tags.md#assigning-tags)
  - [Querying Tags](docs_5x__reference__element-types__tags.md#querying-tags)

You can create folksonomies for your [entries](docs_5x__reference__element-types__entries.md), [users](docs_5x__reference__element-types__users.md), and [assets](docs_5x__reference__element-types__assets.md) using Tags. Tags are another type of [element](docs_5x__system__elements.md).

Migrating to Channels

With the release of Craft 4.4, we began consolidating features of [other element types](docs_5x__system__elements.md) into [entries](docs_5x__reference__element-types__entries.md).

A comparable [tags field](docs_5x__reference__field-types__tags.md) UI has not yet been introduced for entries. If you or your clients value this authoring experience, it is safe to continue using tags!

As part of that process, we introduced a [console command](docs_5x__reference__cli.md#entrify-categories) that can automate the conversion of tags to [channel sections](docs_5x__reference__element-types__entries.md#channels):

```
php craft entrify/tags myTagGroupHandle
```

Read more about this [transition  (opens new window)](https://craftcms.com/blog/entrification) on our blog.

## [#](#tag-groups)Tag Groups

Before you can create tags, you must create Tag Groups to contain them.

To create a new tag group, go to **Settings** → **Tags** and click **New Tag Group**.

Each tag group holds a unique set of tags, and lets you define a custom set of [fields](docs_5x__system__fields.md) that should be available to tags within the group. However, you don’t need to assign any fields to the Tag Group Field Layout in order to use the group.

There is no centralized editing view for tags (like there is for other element types), so fields you attach will only be editable via a [slideout](docs_5x__system__control-panel.md#slideouts), after a tag has been created and assigned to a tag field.

## [#](#assigning-tags)Assigning Tags

To assign tags to things (like Entries), you must create a [Tags field](docs_5x__reference__field-types__tags.md) and add it to a Field Layout.

Each Tags field is connected to a single tag group. Whatever you attach the field to (entries, assets, users, etc.) will be able to create new tags and create [relations](docs_5x__system__relations.md) to any of the tags within that group.

## [#](#querying-tags)Querying Tags

You can fetch tags in your templates or PHP code using a tag query.

TwigPHP

```
{# Create a new tag query #}
{% set myTagQuery = craft.tags() %}
```

```
// Create a new tag query
$myTagQuery = \craft\elements\Tag::find();
```

Once you’ve created a tag query, you can set [parameters](#parameters) on it to narrow down the results, and then [execute it](docs_5x__development__element-queries.md#executing-element-queries) by calling `.all()`. An array of [Tag  (opens new window)](https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v5/craft-elements-tag.html) objects will be returned.

See [Element Queries](docs_5x__development__element-queries.md) to learn about how element queries work.

### [#](#example)Example

We can display a list of the tags in a “Blog Tags” tag group by doing the following:

1. Create a tag query with `craft.tags()`.
2. Set the [group](#group) parameter on it.
3. Fetch the tags with `.all()`.
4. Loop through the tags using a [for  (opens new window)](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/tags/for.html) tag to create the list HTML.

```
{# Create a tag query with the 'group' parameter #}
{% set myTagQuery = craft.tags()
  .group('blogTags') %}

{# Fetch the tags #}
{% set tags = myTagQuery.all() %}

{# Display the tag list #}
<ul>
  {% for tag in tags %}
    <li><a href="{{ url('blog/tags/'~tag.id) }}">{{ tag.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

{# Fetch unique tags from Site A, or Site B if they don’t exist in Site A #}
{% set tags = craft.tags()
  .site('*')
  .unique()
  .preferSites(['a', 'b'])
  .all() %}
