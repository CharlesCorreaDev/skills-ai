Websites and applications are used by people (and machines!) with a wide variety of capabilities.
Craft gives you a powerful suite of tools to help make your projects [accessible](https://craftcms.com/glossary/accessibility "accessible in the Glossary")

…

 to everyone.

## [#](#media)Media

When marked up appropriately, text on the web is inherently accessible.
The same cannot be said for visual media like images, video, and icons; without explicit descriptions or context clues, unsighted users may miss essential content.

### [#](#alternative-text)Alternative text

Every asset in Craft has (at minimum) a **Title**, which is generated from its filename on upload.
You can supplement this with the [native **Alternative Text** field](docs_5x__reference__element-types__assets.md#alt-text) by visiting

1. Settings→
2. Assets→
3. Volumes→
4. Volume Name

and dragging it into the field layout.

Craft uses this field’s value when rendering asset thumbnails in the control panel, and when outputting an image in a Twig template:

TwigResult

```
{{ myAsset.getImg() }}
```

```
<img
  src="https://mydomain.com/uploads/images/screenshot.png"
  width="1280"
  height="800"
  alt="Screenshot of Craft’s asset volume settings page, showing the ">
```

For more control, you can construct `img` tags yourself.
The `alt` attribute can come from anywhere, or be defined via a series of fallbacks:

```
{% set thumb = result.articleThumbnail.one() %}
{{ tag('img', {
  class: 'article-thumbnail',
  src: thumb.getUrl(),
  alt: result.thumbnailDescription ?: thumb.alt,
}) }}
```

This example checks a local `thumbnailDescription` [custom field](docs_5x__system__fields.md) on a `result` entry, and defaults to the `alt` text attached directly to the asset.

Decorative Images

Keep in mind that not *every* use of an image needs alternative text!
This might be a perfectly acceptable way to handle icons attached to [categories](docs_5x__reference__element-types__categories.md) or [tags](docs_5x__reference__element-types__tags.md):

```
{# Decorative or “presentational” icon: #}
{{ tag('img', {
  class: 'icon icon--decorative',
  src: myAsset.getUrl(),
  height: myAsset.getHeight(),
  width: myAsset.getWidth(),
  alt: '',
}) }}
```

The [W3C `alt` Decision Tree  (opens new window)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/) is a great resource for deciding what an appropriate alternative text should be.

An asset’s `title` is often *not* the correct source for descriptions—especially when a file is [uploaded directly to an assets field](docs_5x__reference__field-types__assets.md):

FileTitle

```
# Screenshot:
screenshot_2025-12-31_11-59-59.png

# Photo from digital camera:
IMG_4567.jpg
```

```
# Screenshot:
Screenshot 2025 12 31 11 59 59

# Photo from digital camera:
IMG 4567
```

For this reason, Craft *does not* attempt to repair a missing `alt` attribute by falling back to the title in the absence of explicit alternative text. Generic or irrelevant alt text is also a barrier for screen reader users, and one that can be difficult to identify without a manual accessibility audit. Instead, we leave the `alt` attribute off entirely so the image can be flagged by automated accessibility tests.
Below, we cover [a few patterns](#alt-text-overrides) that make alternative text easier to maintain.

#### [#](#rich-text)Rich Text

Inserting an image into a rich text editor may not automatically populate `alt` attributes.

- **[Redactor  (opens new window)](https://plugins.craftcms.com/redactor)** — Select an inserted image and pick **Edit** to open a modal. Redactor incorrectly labels the alternative text field as its **Title**.
- **[CKEditor  (opens new window)](https://plugins.craftcms.com/ckeditor)** — Select an inserted image and pick the **Change image text alternative** button to add a description.

Both plugins also support captions, which convert the image into `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements.

### [#](#video-and-captioning)Video and captioning

Craft also uses the native `alt` attribute for transcripts on video and audio.
Transcripts are shown when previewing media in the control panel.

There is currently no built-in support for time-based transcripts or closed captioning (in the control panel or front-end), but you are free to implement them via custom fields:

```
<video id="player" src="{{ asset.getUrl() }}">

{# Assume `chapters` is a table field: #}
<ul>
  {% for chapter in asset.chapters %}
    {% set ts = chapter.timestamp | integer %}
    <li>
      <button data-timestamp="{{ ts }}" title="Seek to {{ ts }} seconds">
        {{ '%d:%02d' | format(ts // 60, ts % 60) }}
      </button>
      {{ chapter.description }}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

<script>
  const $video = document.getElementById('player');
  const $chapters = document.querySelectorAll('[data-timestamp]');

  $chapters.forEach(function($chapter) {
    $chapter.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
      $video.currentTime = parseFloat($chapter.dataset.timestamp);
    });
  });
</script>
```

Highlighting or announcing the currently-active chapter or timestamp requires additional scripting.

### [#](#reference-tags)Reference tags

The [reference tag](docs_5x__system__reference-tags.md) parser will call magic “getter” methods, so you can get a complete `<img>` element using a syntax like this:

```
{asset:1234:img}
```

### [#](#markdown)Markdown

Craft’s Markdown parser supports [image tags  (opens new window)](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#img):

```
![My alt text](/path/to/image.jpg)
```

You may include a hard-coded URL, or use a [reference tag](#reference-tags) to ensure it remains up-to-date.

## [#](#recipes)Recipes

### [#](#alt-text-overrides)`alt` text overrides

An image may need different descriptions based on its usage.
For example, if you were working with an artist collective, you may have a library of members’ work, with practical or evergreen descriptions… but when an author recycles one of those images for a news post, that description may be confusing.

You have two options for applying local description overrides:

1. **Add a plain text field to the same field layout as your assets field.**  
   When an author populates this field, use that text instead of the asset’s `alt` attribute:

   ```
   {% set image = entry.myFeatureImage.one() %}
   {% set description = entry.myFeatureImageDescription ?: image.alt %}

   {{ tag('img', {
     src: image.getUrl(),
     alt: description,
   }) }}
   ```
2. **Componentize descriptions with a content block.**
   If you wish to implement the same logic on a number of pages, it may make sense to encapsulate it in a [content block field](docs_5x__reference__field-types__content-block.md):

   ![Screenshot of an entry edit screen, showing a content block field with nested image and description fields.](/docs/assets/img/accessibility-recipe-image-preview-block.774998c4.png)

   The content block field can then be accessed as `entry.imageWithDescription`, and the “override” logic is standardized wherever you include it (rather than via novel field handles in each situation):

   entry.twiga11y-image.twig

   ```
   {# Include this anywhere that uses the `imageWithDescription` content block field: #}
   {{ include('_partials/a11y-image', {
     ctx: entry.imageWithDescription,
   }) }}
   ```

   ```
   {% set image = ctx.image.one() %}
   {% set description = ctx.description ?: image.alt }}

   {{ tag('img', {
     src: image.getUrl(),
     alt: description,
   }) }}
   ```

   In this example, `ally-image.twig` doesn’t know (or care) where it was included from—everything it needs to resolve a proper description is available in the passed `ctx` variable, via consistent field handles.

   Content block fields are single-instance, meaning they can only appear in a field layout *once*.
   However, they *can* be given new handles, be used in any number of field layouts, and be repeated inside nested entries Matrix field.

### [#](#accessible-previews)Accessible previews

You can show authors a final representation of an image (with the resolved alt text) using a **Template** UI [field layout element](docs_5x__system__fields.md#ui-elements):

![Screenshot of an entry edit screen, showing a special UI field layout element that renders a preview of an attached image and its resolved accessible description.](/docs/assets/img/accessibility-recipe-image-preview.30f08785.png)

The template might look something like this:

```
{% set image = element.featureImage.one() %}
{% if image %}
    {% set hasGlobalDescription = image.alt is not empty %}
    {% set hasCustomDescription = element.featureImageDescription is not empty %}
    {% set description = element.featureImageDescription ?: image.alt %}

    <div class="pane">
        <h2>Feature Image Preview</h2>
        <img src="{{ image.getUrl() }}" alt="{{ description }}">

        {% if hasCustomDescription %}
            {# Use `del` and `ins` when both are present: #}
            {% if hasGlobalDescription %}
                <del>{{ image.alt }}</del>
                <ins>{{ element.featureImageDescription }}</ins>
            {% else %}
                <p>{{ element.featureImageDescription }}</p>
            {% endif %}
        {% else if hasGlobalDescription %}
            {# Just surface the original text: #}
            <p>{{ image.alt }}</p>
        {% else %}
          {# Uh oh! #}
          <p class="error">No accessible description is available for this image. Please add one to this article (using the **Feature Image Description** field, above), or set a default one on the image itself.</p>
        {% endif %}
    </div>
{% endif %}
```

This is essentially a more verbose implementation of the fallback logic discussed in the [alternative text section](#alternative-text).

You can do the same thing within the content block-based override!

### [#](#jump-links-and-labels)Jump links and labels

Many accessibility attributes (like `aria-describedby` and `aria-controls`) require absolute, unique identifiers.
Suppose you allow authors to create tabbed “tour” interfaces, within a page builder—
tab names may collide if they are based on content (`tab.label | handle`) or a sequence (`tab-#{loop.index0}`).

For content with `id`s or `uid`s, you may have enough to reliably connect pieces of an interface.
Everything else (like rows in a [table field](docs_5x__reference__field-types__table.md)) will require generating temporary identifiers:

```
{% set tabMap = collect([]) %}
{% set groupId = "tab-group-#{random()}" %}

{# The name for this group of tabs could be something dynamic: #}
<h2 id="{{ groupId }}-label">Tab List</h2>

<div role="tablist" aria-labelledby="{{ groupId }}-label">
  {# Loop over once to output tabs: #}
  {% for tab in tabs %}
    {# Create a temporary ID and add it to the map: #}
    {% set id = "pane-#{random()}" %}
    {% do tabMap.set(id, tab) %}

    <button
      id="{{ id }}-tab"
      role="tab"
      aria-controls="{{ id }}">
      {{ tab.label }}
    </button>
  {% endfor %}
</div>

{# ... #}

{# Loop over the decorated `tabMap` to output the controlled elements: #}
{% for id, tab in tabMap %}
  <div id="{{ id }}" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="{{ id }}-tab">
    {# ... #}
  </div>
{% endfor %}
```

This will create identifiers that look something like `pane-63570161`.
Note that we’re creating a two-way binding between the `tab` and `tabpanel`:

- The `tab` has an `aria-controls` attribute containing the raw identifier, and an `id` attribute with the identifier and a suffix.
- The `tabpanel` has an `id` attribute containing the raw identifier and an `aria-labelledby` attribute, with the identifier and a `-tab` suffix.

## [#](#testing-and-auditing)Testing and auditing

The best time to audit your front-end for accessibility is during the design phase. The next best time is during development.

As you build your templates, tools like Deque’s [Axe DevTools for Web  (opens new window)](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/web-accessibility) can flag violations and help you prioritize remediation.

To monitor content accessibility and quickly identify issues after launch, consider using a tool like [Accessible Web  (opens new window)](https://accessibleweb.com/)’s [automated scanning tool  (opens new window)](https://accessibleweb.com/ramp-web-accessibility-tools/accessibility-monitoring/). Keep in mind that automated scans catch only a fraction of accessibility issues, and manual testing should also be part of your process.

Set up a [custom source](docs_5x__system__elements.md#sources) for your assets using the **Has alternative text** condition rule to give authors a central place to remedy missing image descriptions:
