# Entries

  - [Entry Types](docs_5x__reference__element-types__entries.md#entry-types)
  - [Sections](docs_5x__reference__element-types__entries.md#sections)
  - [Sources](docs_5x__reference__element-types__entries.md#sources)

Entries are flexible content containers that—unlike [addresses](docs_5x__reference__element-types__addresses.md), [assets](docs_5x__reference__element-types__assets.md), or [categories](docs_5x__reference__element-types__categories.md)—have no primary or implied function. They are entirely agnostic building blocks, used to model whatever kind of content or data your project needs.

All entries support some key features like **Authors**, a **Post Date** and **Expiration Date**, **Statuses**, and content defined via [field layouts](docs_5x__system__fields.md). Additional features and properties are determined via [entry types](#entry-types), or the [sections](#sections) and [Matrix fields](docs_5x__reference__field-types__matrix.md) they’re used in.

Authors can use the [drafts and revisions](#editing-entries) system to stage different versions of content and preview it before going live.

## [#](#entry-types)Entry Types

Craft uses *entry types* to define atomic units of content, which are then exposed to editors via [sections](#sections) and [Matrix fields](docs_5x__reference__field-types__matrix.md).

Global Entry Types

Entry types became a global resource in Craft 5. This means you can define a content type *once*, then use it in multiple sections, as a [nested](#nested-entries) block in a [Matrix](docs_5x__reference__field-types__matrix.md) field, or some combination of the two. As a result, some settings have moved around!

Most importantly, you’ll manage entry types in the **Settings** → **Entry Types** screen—or create them on-the-fly in a slideout when working on a section or Matrix field.

Editing an entry type in the control panel.

Entry types have the following settings:

- **Name** — Used throughout the control panel as a UI label.
- **Handle** — Uniquely identifies entries of this type in [templates](docs_5x__development__templates.md) and [queries](docs_5x__development__element-queries.md).
- **Description**  [5.8.0+](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/5.8.0/CHANGELOG.md "Entry type descriptions was first available in version 5.8.0 of Craft.") — A short explanation of what the entry type is used for. This is displayed in a tooltip when the entry type is selected elsewhere in the control panel.
- **Icon** and **Color** — Choose a symbol and color to subtly distinguish entries of this type throughout the control panel.
- **UI Label Format**  [5.9.0+](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/5.9.0/CHANGELOG.md "Entry type UI label formats was first available in version 5.9.0 of Craft.") — Customize this entry type’s labels (used primarily on [element chips and cards](docs_5x__system__elements.md#chips--cards)). Use this to more accurately describe entries in the control panel, without also affecting titles.
- **Title Translation Method** — In multi-site projects, choose how titles are localized.
- **Default Title Format** — Entry titles can be set by the author or [dynamically defined](#dynamic-entry-titles) from other values via an [object template](docs_5x__system__object-templates.md).
- **Allow line breaks in titles** — Display the title field as a multi-line input, and retain newline characters. Newlines are not rendered in the control panel, and must be decorated in the front-end using the `nl2br` filter or other logic.  [5.9.0+](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/5.9.0/CHANGELOG.md "Line breaks in titles was first available in version 5.9.0 of Craft.")
- **Show the Slug field** — As with titles, slugs can be manually or automatically generated.
  - **Slug Translation Method** — In multi-site projects, choose how slugs are localized.
- **Show the Status field** — Manually set each entry’s status, or allow it to be dictated by its usage.
- **Field Layout** — Add and arrange [custom fields](docs_5x__system__fields.md) to suit your content model.
- **Generated Fields**  [5.8.0+](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/5.8.0/CHANGELOG.md "Generated fields was first available in version 5.8.0 of Craft.") — Create additional [virtual attributes](docs_5x__system__elements.md#generated-fields) on entries of this type from short [object templates](docs_5x__system__object-templates.md).
- **Card Attributes** — Select which attributes and fields appear on [cards](docs_5x__system__elements.md#chips-cards) of this type.

When you’re done configuring an entry type, press **Save** or `Ctrl/Command + S` to apply the changes.

Entry types can be duplicated or cloned by using the **Save** menu’s **Save as new entry type** option.  [5.8.0+](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/5.8.0/CHANGELOG.md "Duplicating entry types was first available in version 5.8.0 of Craft.")

### [#](#aliases)Aliases [5.6.0+](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/5.6.0/CHANGELOG.md "Entry type aliases was first available in version 5.6.0 of Craft.")

When attaching an entry type to a [section](#sections) or [field](docs_5x__reference__field-types__matrix.md), you can configure a local override for its **Name** and **Handle**. This affects labels in the control panel, but does *not* change how you reference them in queries.

As an example, an *Announcement* entry type could be used in a *News* section and a *Content* Matrix or [CKEditor  (opens new window)](https://plugins.craftcms.com/ckeditor) field; in the *Content* field context, the entry type is given a new **Name** (*Banner*) and handle (`banner`). Authors would then see *Banner* when selecting **New entry** in the CKEditor toolbar, but developers would need to continue using the original, global handle to directly query those nested entries:

```
{% set embeddedAnnouncements = craft.entries()
  .field('pageContent')
  .type('announcement')
  .all() %}
```

However, when *accessing* the entry type via those nested entries (or an entry within a section), the aliases are applied automatically:

```
{% set announcements = craft.entries()
  .type('announcement')
  .all() %}

{% for announcement in announcements %}
  <article>
    <h2>{{ announcement.title }}</h2>
    <span class="type">{{ announcement.type.name }}</span>
    {{ announcement.body|md }}
  </article>
{% endfor %}
```

In this example, `announcement.type.name` might resolve to *Critical Release* in one section, but *New Face* in another—even though we queried for them using the original, global handle. To access the global [craft\models\EntryType  (opens new window)](https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v5/craft-models-entrytype.html), use `entry.type.original`.

This can help improve the legibility of templates, wherein the generic `announcement` handle doesn’t describe how the entry type is actually used:

```
{% for contentBlock in entry.myMatrixField %}
  <div class="content-block content-block--type-{{ contentBlock.type.handle }}">
    {% switch contentBlock.type.handle %}
      {% case 'carousel'}
        {# ... #}
      {% case 'recommended'}
        {# ... #}
      {% case 'banner' %}
        {# Perhaps “Banner” made more sense than “Announcement” in this context, when designing! #}
        <h3>{{ contentBlock.title }}</h3>
        {{ contentBlock.message|md }}
      {% default %}
        {{ contentBlock.render() }}
    {% endswitch %}
  </div>
{% endfor %}
```

### [#](#dynamic-entry-titles)Dynamic Entry Titles

The **Default Title Format** field accepts an [object template](docs_5x__system__object-templates.md) (just like the **Entry URI Format** and preview target **URL Format** we looked, above), and is evaluated whenever entries with this type are saved *without an explicitly-set title*. A title format may be rendered multiple times, depending on the selected **Title Translation Method**.

If you want your entries’ titles to *always* be generated from a template (and disallow authors from providing their own titles), remove the **Title** element from the [field layout](docs_5x__system__fields.md#field-layouts).  [5.5.0+](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/5.5.0/CHANGELOG.md "Default title formats and removable titles was first available in version 5.5.0 of Craft.")

Prior to Craft 5.5.0, this behavior was governed by two settings (**Show the Title field** and **Show the Title field?**), with no intermediate “default” option.

You also have control over the labels used to identify your entries in [chips and cards](docs_5x__system__elements.md#chips-cards), with the **UI Label Format** setting.  [5.9.0+](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/5.9.0/CHANGELOG.md "Entry type UI label formats was first available in version 5.9.0 of Craft.")

### [#](#translation-settings)Translation Settings

Most localization behavior is determined by [section](#sections) and [field](docs_5x__system__fields.md) settings, but the translation of titles and slugs is governed by entry types.

The available translation methods are covered in the [custom fields documentation](docs_5x__system__fields.md#translation-methods).

## [#](#sections)Sections

Sections organize and expose [entry types](#entry-types) for content authors. In each section you can define the following:

- Whether entries in the section have URLs;
- What the entries’ URLs should look like;
- Which template should get loaded if an entry’s URL is requested;
- What preview targets are available to authors;
- What [entry types](#entry-types) are available in the section;
- How many authors can be associated with each entry (or disable authors  [5.7.0+](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/5.7.0/CHANGELOG.md "Authorless sections was first available in version 5.7.0 of Craft."));

If your project has multiple [sites](docs_5x__system__sites.md), your section can define these additional settings:

- Which sites entries in the section should target;
- Which sites entries are created in, by default;

To create a new section, go to

1. Settings→
2. Sections

and choose **New Section**.

### [#](#section-types)Section Types

Craft has three different types of sections:

#### [#](#singles)Singles

![Illustration of Entries layout with “Singles” selected, showing “About Us”, “Contact” and “Home” entries](/docs/assets/img/section-types-singles.f9639bdc.png)

Singles are used for one-off pages or content objects that have unique requirements, such as…

- …a website’s homepage;
- …an *About Us* page;
- …a *Contact Us* page;

Unlike the other section types, singles only ever have *one* entry associated with them, meaning their URIs can be static (like `contact-us`) rather than templatized (like `news/{slug}`).

Singles have all the functionality of [globals](docs_5x__reference__element-types__globals.md), and can even be pre-loaded into global Twig variables with the [preloadSingles](docs_5x__reference__config__general.md#preloadsingles) config setting. As such, singles don’t have an editable **Author**, **Post Date**, or **Expiration Date**.

A single’s **Status** controls can be hidden with the **Show the Status field** setting in its selected **Entry Type**.

#### [#](#channels)Channels

![Illustration of Entries layout with a “Press Releases” channel selected, showing three dated news entries](/docs/assets/img/section-types-channels.b3fa59a9.png)

Channels are used for lists or streams of similar content, such as…

- …posts on a blog;
- …articles in a knowledge base;
- …recipes;
- …reviews;

Entries in channels are intended to be queried and displayed ordered by one or more of their attributes or [custom fields](docs_5x__system__fields.md). Channels are also a simple way to maintain a flat taxonomy, standing in for [tags](docs_5x__reference__element-types__tags.md) or [categories](docs_5x__reference__element-types__categories.md).

#### [#](#structures)Structures

Structures are an extension of channels that support explicit, hierarchical organization.

![Illustration of Entries layout with a “Galleries” structure selected, showing nested building and gallery entries with drag-and-drop handles](/docs/assets/img/section-types-structures.4056a35f.png)

Unlike other section types, structure sections expose a **Structure** view option on their [element indexes](docs_5x__system__elements.md#indexes):

![Illustration of an element index’s “View” options with “Structure” selected.](/docs/assets/img/section-types-structure-view-mode.0b691a91.png)

Types of content that might benefit from being defined as a structure include…

- …documentation;
- …a “Services” section, where the order of services matters;
- …a company organization chart with personnel and teams;
- …editable navigation menus;

Just like channels, entries in structures can be assigned [types](#entry-types). Structures offer great flexibility in presentation—in particular, the ability to collect nested content on a parent page, or alter the appearance of pages based on their hierarchical “depth” within a bundle of content.

Structures have the following additional settings:

Max Levels
:   Decide how many levels deep authors can organize entries.

Default Entry Placement
:   Choose where new entries are placed in the structure. This setting applies when that entry has no parent entry (before or after other “root” entries), *and* when a parent is selected (before or after other entries with the same parent), as well as when an entry is [moved](#moving-entries-between-sections) into the section.  [5.3.0+](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/5.3.0/CHANGELOG.md "Moving entries between sections was first available in version 5.3.0 of Craft.")

Structures can also make use of the **Maintain Hierarchy** setting on [entries fields](docs_5x__reference__field-types__entries.md).

Entries belonging to a structure are discrete from [nested entries](#nested-entries) in [Matrix](docs_5x__reference__field-types__matrix.md) fields. Structure entries can be freely moved around in their hierarchy (receiving new “parent” elements in the process), whereas nested entries are always owned by the element they were created within.

### [#](#entry-uri-formats)Entry URI Formats

Channel and structure sections can choose whether their entries should be given URLs in the system by filling in the **Entry URI Format** setting. Singles also have this setting, but it is typically a static path or omitted (if it doesn’t need its own URL, like a [global set](docs_5x__reference__element-types__globals.md)).

The entry URI format is an [object template](docs_5x__system__object-templates.md), which gets evaluated each time an entry in the section is saved. The result is saved as the entry’s **URI** in the system, and is used to generate URLs (i.e. via `entry.url`) and when Craft is determining how to [route](docs_5x__system__routing.md) a request.

When Craft matches a request to an entry, its section’s designated **Template** is rendered. That template is automatically provided an `entry` variable, set to the resolved [craft\elements\Entry  (opens new window)](https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v5/craft-elements-entry.html) object, and ready to output any of its attributes or custom field data.

#### [#](#uri-recipes)URI Recipes

Consider these tips for creating special URIs:

- A URI that evaluates to `__home__` (and nothing more) will be available at your site’s base path (this should only be used for [singles](#singles));
- An empty URI means the entry does not get a route and will not have a public URL—unless you define one manually via `routes.php`;
- Any Twig statement can be used to output values in a URI template—including ones that query for other elements, e.g. `{{ craft.entries().section('mySingle').one().slug }}/news` (see note below);
- [Aliases](docs_5x__configure.md#aliases-and-environment-variables) can be evaluated with the [`alias()` function](docs_5x__reference__twig__functions.md#alias): `{{ alias('@basePressUri') }}/news`, `{{ alias('@mySectionUri') }}`.
- The [null-coalescing operator  (opens new window)](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/templates.html#other-operators) (`??`) can silently swallow undefined variable errors (like `parent.uri`, above);

Elements accessed via the current `object` (like authors or [relational fields](docs_5x__system__relations.md#custom-fields)) will be loaded in the appropriate site, but *new* element queries (like the example above that uses `craft.entries()`), must explicitly use `.site()` or `.siteId()` to load elements in the same site. The current element’s site can always be accessed via `object.site` or `object.siteId`, respectively:

```
{craft.entries().section('mySingle').site(object.site).one().slug}
```

If you only have one site, you can omit this for brevity; similarly, if the resolved value tends to be the same as a value you’re already storing in project config, consider hard-coding it.

**Do not** use element IDs directly in URI formats. They are not a [reliable identifier](docs_5x__system__project-config.md#ids-uuids-and-handles) across environments. For example, keeping channel entries’ URLs synchronized with a [single](#singles) using this format…

```
{craft.entries().id(123).one().slug}/{slug}
```

…may load the correct entry in development, but find a different one on your live site. Use a handle (like the example above) for consistency!

#### [#](#hierarchical-uris)Hierarchical URIs

Structure sections may benefit from nested paths, for child entries:

```
{parent.uri}/{slug}
```

Suppose our structure represents geographic regions on Earth. With the above **Entry URI Format**, a top-level “continent” entry URI might be `south-america`; a nested “country” entry’s URI would then be `south-america/chile`.

Structure sections might also want to include a segment before the nested path:

```
{parent.uri ?? 'earth'}/{slug}
```

The above template could also be expressed with this syntax:

```
{% if level == 1 %}earth{% else %}{parent.uri}{% endif %}/{slug}
```

With the above Entry URI Format, a top-level entry’s URI would be `earth/south-america`, with a nested entry having `earth/south-america/chile`.

#### [#](#nested-entry-urls)Nested Entry URLs

[Nested entries](#nested-entries) in [Matrix fields](docs_5x__reference__field-types__matrix.md) can also be configured to have URLs—but the settings are part of the field, not a section. As a result, entries of a given [type](#entry-types) may have URLs in some contexts, and not in others!

In a nested entry’s URI format, you can access the *owner*’s attributes using `{owner.someAttribute}`:

```
{owner.uri}/steps/{slug}
```

### [#](#preview-targets-team-pro)Preview Targets Team Pro

Section can have one or more **Preview Targets**, or URLs where its entries are expected to be visible. This makes it possible for authors to preview entries as they are writing them in the control panel, or share a private URL with colleagues to view changes prior to publishing.

Like entry URI formats, these preview target URLs are simple Twig templates that can contain entry properties and other dynamic values.

Use single curly braces to render attributes on the entry. For example if entries in your section have their own URLs, then you can create a preview target for the entry’s primary URL using the URL template, `{url}`.

Create additional preview targets for any other areas the entry might show up, such as `news`, or `archive/{postDate|date('Y')}`. If the entries show up on the homepage, you can create a preview target with a blank URL (unlike URI formats, a blank URL *is* valid, here).

![A section’s Preview Targets setting.](/docs/assets/img/preview-targets.754577af.png)

Preview target **URL Formats** support slightly different features than for **URI Formats**:

- If you want to include the entry’s ID or UID in a preview target URL, use `{canonicalId}` or `{canonicalUid}` rather than `{id}` or `{uid}`, so the source entry’s ID or UID is used rather than the [draft](#drafts)’s;
- You can use [environment variables and aliases](docs_5x__configure.md#control-panel-settings) in the preview target URL. These *do not* get wrapped in curly braces on their own, as they are not part of the [object template](docs_5x__system__object-templates.md). Aliases may be part of a longer URI (e.g.`@headlessUrl/news/{slug}`), but environment variables can only be used on their own (e.g. `$NEWS_INDEX`);

When an author is editing an entry from a section with custom preview targets, the **View** button will be replaced with a menu that lists the **Primary entry page** (if the section has an Entry URI Format), plus the names of each preview target.

![An entry’s View menu with 3 custom preview targets.](/docs/assets/img/share-with-targets.29e30863.png)

If you share a link from this menu that includes a preview token, it will expire by default after one day. You can customize this with the [defaultTokenDuration](docs_5x__reference__config__general.md#defaulttokenduration) config setting.

The targets will also be available within **Preview**.

#### [#](#previewing-decoupled-front-ends)Previewing Decoupled Front Ends

If your site’s front end lives outside of Craft (e.g. as a Vue or React app), you can still support previewing drafts and revisions with **Preview** or **Share** buttons. To do that, your front end must check for the existence of a `token` query string parameter (or whatever the [tokenParam](docs_5x__reference__config__general.md#tokenparam) setting is). If it’s in the URL, then you will need to pass that same token in the request that loads the page content. This token will cause the API request to respond with the correct content based on what the token was created to preview.

Nuxt Example

Whether you are using the Element API plugin or the built-in [GraphQL](docs_5x__development__graphql.md) API, Craft automatically injects preview elements whenever they match the query being executed.

To illustrate, suppose you were building a [Nuxt  (opens new window)](https://nuxt.com/) application, and you used the [file-based routing scheme  (opens new window)](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/routing) to render blog posts: you would create `pages/blog/[slug].vue`, then define a preview target in Craft with a similar path, like `@nuxt/blog/{slug}`.

```
<script setup>
const route = useRoute();

// Construct a GraphQL fragment using the route param:
const query = `{
  entry(slug: "${route.params.slug}") {
    title
    description
  }
}`;

// Fetch the incoming token:
const token = route.query.token;

// Build the URL, with `query` and `token` params:
const { data: gql } = await useFetch('https://my-project.ddev.site/api', {
  params: { query, token },
});
</script>

<template>
  <article>
    <h1>{{ gql.data.entry.title }}</h1>
    <code>{{ gql.data.entry.uid }}</code>
  </article>
</template>
```

This assumes you have defined a [GraphQL API route](docs_5x__development__graphql.md#setting-up-your-api-endpoint) of `api`, and that the previewed entry will reliably have (at least) a slug set. When the `token` param is omitted, Nuxt ignores it and the GraphQL API will respond as though it were any other request for an entry with the given slug.

You can pass the token via either a query string parameter named after your [tokenParam](docs_5x__reference__config__general.md#tokenparam) config setting, or an `X-Craft-Token` header.

For live preview, you should also consider [enabling iFrame Resizer](docs_5x__reference__config__general.md#useiframeresizer) so that Craft can maintain the page scroll position between page loads.

### [#](#moving-entries-between-sections)Moving Entries Between Sections [5.3.0+](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/5.3.0/CHANGELOG.md "Transferring entries between sections was first available in version 5.3.0 of Craft.")

Entries in [channel](#channels) and [structure](#structures) sections can be moved to other sections that support the same [entry type](#entry-types). Use the **Move to…** element action from any entry element index, then select the new section. If the action is disabled, the entry has no suitable targets—you may be able to change its entry type *in-situ*, reconcile any custom field changes, then move it to a compatible section.

When moving an entry, it’s important to note these behaviors:

- If the new section is a structure, the entry will be placed at the root, according to its **Default Entry Placement** setting.
- [Drafts and revisions](docs_5x__system__drafts-revisions.md) will be moved along with the entry and remain accessible, but only drafts that use an entry type that is allowed in the new section can be restored—same as if an entry type were *removed* from a section.
- If the new section has a lower **Max authors** setting, author data will remain intact and produce a validation error when saved.
- Authors who don’t have access to the new section will also be removed, the next time the entry is saved. Permissions are still checked based on the section, not authorship.
- Singles will never appear as targets for moving an entry.

You can also [copy and paste](#copying-entries) entries between compatible sections and [Matrix](docs_5x__reference__field-types__matrix.md) fields.

## [#](#sources)Sources

You can supplement the automatic [sources](docs_5x__system__elements.md#sources) presented in the entries [element index](docs_5x__system__elements.md#indexes) with custom *pages*  [5.9.0+](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/5.9.0/CHANGELOG.md "Customizing top-level entry source groups was first available in version 5.9.0 of Craft.") and *sources*.

![The source customization modal, introduced in Craft 5.9.0](/docs/assets/img/entries-customize-sources.aaf7ca92.png)

### [#](#pages)Pages [5.9.0+](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/5.9.0/CHANGELOG.md "Customizing top-level entry source groups was first available in version 5.9.0 of Craft.")

By default, all sources are created inside a single **Entries** page.
You may divide those sources into as many pages as necessary, each with their own label and icon.
Each page is then given a top-level navigation menu item.

Sources can be moved from one page to another by dragging-and-dropping, or using the action menu and selecting one of the **Move to …** options.

### [#](#custom-sources)Custom Sources

In addition to the sources created for each section, you can define any number of additional *custom sources*.
Custom sources list all non-nested entries by default, but can define **Entry Criteria** to hone the index, and set **Default Table Columns** that make sense for the content.
Control panel users can add temporary tweaks using [filters and columns](docs_5x__system__elements.md#filters-and-columns) controls on each index.
Conditions provided this way are *additive*, meaning the base criteria cannot be relaxed.

All users are able to access custom sources, but Craft still enforces section-based permissions for viewing and editing.

Built-in sources are differentiated by the presence of a handle, derived from its [section](#sections) (save for the special **All entries** source).

## [#](#nested-entries)Nested Entries

Entries also power the [Matrix](docs_5x__reference__field-types__matrix.md) and [CKEditor  (opens new window)](https://plugins.craftcms.com/ckeditor) fields, which means your [entry types](#entry-types) can represent entire pages, or the building blocks thereof. How you implement your content model and authoring experience is entirely up to you!

Nested entries are an implementation of nested *elements*, a broader category of “owned” elements that includes [addresses](docs_5x__reference__element-types__addresses.md) and powers Commerce’s product and variant architecture. The [Content Block](docs_5x__reference__field-types__content-block.md) field also stores data in a nested entry.

## [#](#editing-entries)Editing Entries

If you have at least one section, there will be an **Entries** menu item in the primary control panel navigation. Clicking on it will take you to the entry [index](docs_5x__system__elements.md#indexes). From there, you can navigate to the entry you wish to edit, or create a new one.

Depending on your section’s settings, can perform some or all of the following actions from any entry’s edit screen:

- Choose the entry type (if there is more than one to choose from);
- Edit the entry’s **Title**, **Slug**, and [custom field](docs_5x__system__fields.md) values;
- Choose the entry’s **Authors** Team Pro;
- Choose the entry’s **Parent** (if it’s within a [Structure](#structures) section);
- Set the entry’s **Post Date** (when it will be considered published);
- Set the entry’s **Expiration Date** (optional);
- Choose whether the entry is **Enabled** or not (globally, and/or per-site);
- Save changes to the entry;
- Save a new [draft](#drafts) of the entry;
- View [revisions](#revisions) of the entry;
- Apply changes from a derivative (draft or revision);

If you leave the **Post Date** blank, Craft will automatically set it the first time an entry is saved as enabled.

Propose and track changes to your content with powerful workflow tools.](docs_5x__system__drafts-revisions.md)

### [#](#entry-creation)Entry Creation

As soon as you click **New entry**, Craft creates an empty entry, and redirects you to its edit screen. This gives the system a place to auto-save your edits—effectively a new entry represented only as a [draft](#drafts). Internally, this is called a “fresh” entry.

Once you add some content to a fresh entry (or explicitly choose **Save draft** from the **Create entry** menu), Craft marks the draft as having been saved, and will expose it in element indexes when using the **All** or **Draft** status options.

Stray drafts (those that were created but never edited or explicitly saved) are automatically [garbage-collected](docs_5x__system__gc.md), respecting the [purgeUnsavedDraftsDuration](docs_5x__reference__config__general.md#purgeunsaveddraftsduration) setting.

The entry editing lifecycle is designed to provide authors clear, actionable information about the state of their content, and to prevent unintended loss. Let’s look more closely at a few supporting features.

### [#](#drafts)Drafts

As soon as you alter a field on an entry, Craft auto-saves the changes as a [provisional draft](docs_5x__system__drafts-revisions.md#provisional-drafts).

![Screenshot of an entry with unsaved changes](/docs/assets/img/entries-edit-provisional.c687e1f4.png)

Subsequent edits are also saved to your provisional draft, and made available any time you view that entry in the control panel. Each user gets their own provisional draft, so your changes are private.

Pressing the **Save** button applies changes from a provisional draft to its *canonical* entry, and creates a *revision* (if its section supports revisions).

If you aren’t ready to publish your changes, you can instead press **Create a Draft** to save your work as a new *draft*. You may have as many regular drafts as you wish—and those drafts can have their own name and notes to help you track what you’re working on. The name of your current draft (if any) is shown at the top of the edit screen in the [revision](#revisions) menu.

Your drafts may be visible to (and editable by) other users! While an auto-saved *provisional* draft is always private, the visibility of *saved* drafts is governed by users’ [permissions for the entry’s section](docs_5x__system__user-management.md#permissions).

While Craft’s auto-saving behavior creates a provisional draft from the canonical entry, edits to an existing, explicitly-saved draft are saved directly to that draft—in other words, Craft doesn’t create drafts for another draft!

When your edits are ready to be published, press **Apply draft** to merge the changes into the canonical entry.

### [#](#revisions)Revisions

Any time you apply a draft (provisional or otherwise) to the canonical entry, Craft creates a *revision*. Revisions track which fields and attributes changed each time the canonical entry is updated, and provide a means to revert to previous versions of an entry. Drafts and revisions both have a `creator` property that stores what user initiated the update separately from the “author.”

The revision menu only displays the ten most recent revisions. Older revisions are available via the **View all revisions →** link at the bottom of the menu.

Any time a revision is created, Craft pushes a job into the [queue](docs_5x__system__queue.md) to ensure the oldest one(s) are pruned (if there are more revisions than allowed by the [maxRevisions](docs_5x__reference__config__general.md#maxrevisions) setting).

#### [#](#querying-for-revisions)Querying for Revisions

You can [find](#querying-entries) drafts and revisions of a specific entry using the [draftOf()](#draftof) and [revisionOf()](#revisionof) query params.

### [#](#trash)Trash

All [elements](docs_5x__system__elements.md) support *soft-deletion*. When you delete an entry, its `dateDeleted` property is set to the current time, and Craft excludes it from results—unless the [`trashed` query param](#trashed) is used. Similarly, when restoring a deleted entry, its `dateDeleted` is set to `null`.

Entries remain in the “trashed” state until they are manually hard-deleted from the control panel or their `dateDeleted` is longer ago than the [softDeleteDuration](docs_5x__reference__config__general.md#softdeleteduration) setting when [garbage collection](docs_5x__system__gc.md) runs.

**The trash should not be used to temporarily remove content from your site.** Restoring trashed entries is only intended as a means to recover inadvertently-deleted content—instead, use the global or site-specific **Enabled** settings. Entries can remain disabled indefinitely.

### [#](#activity)Activity

Craft keeps track of user activity on entries, and will push presence pips and notifications to anyone working with drafts of the same entry.

my-craft-project.ddev.site/admin/entries/blog/247

![Screenshot of the entry edit screen with other active users](/docs/assets/img/entries-edit-activity.58abee9d.png)

Other users editing the same entry will appear in the page header. TJ has corrected the page title in a draft.

Notifications will appear in the bottom-left corner along with other flashes, and prompt you to reload the entry if it has changed since you opened it. This can play out in a couple ways:

- If another user applied a draft to the canonical entry while you were working on a provisional draft, Craft will merge all non-conflicting edits into your provisional draft. In situations where you both made changes to a field, Craft keeps your changes.
- If only the other user made a change, the page simply refreshes to show the new canonical entry content.

Automatic merging of changes from canonical entries is nondestructive, and non-optional. Merging occurs just before an entry’s edit screen is viewed.

### [#](#copying-entries)Copying Entries [5.7.0+](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/5.7.0/CHANGELOG.md "Copying entries was first available in version 5.7.0 of Craft.")

Entries can be copied and pasted between sections and fields that support the given type(s).

[Copying Elements

## [#](#statuses)Statuses

In addition to the [base element statuses](docs_5x__system__elements.md#statuses), entries may appear in any of these states:

- **Pending** (`pending`) — The **Post Date** is in the future, or not set.
- **Expired** (`expired`) — The **Expiry Date** is set, and in the past.
- **Live** (`live`) — The **Post Date** is in the past, and the **Expiry Date** is in the future (if set at all). This is the default status used in entry queries.

Status pips and controls may be hidden from element edit screes, indexes, chips, and cards, if an entry’s type has the **Show the Status field** setting *off*.

When [querying entries by status](docs_5x__system__elements.md#querying-by-status), keep in mind that each status identifier in the list above represents multiple conditions. Statuses and their default query conditions help make the appearance or availability of entries consistent between the control panel and front-end; for this reason, params like `.postDate()` and `.expiryDate()` introduce *additional* constraints, rather than replacing Craft’s. If you need full control over the query constraints, call `.status(null)`.

### [#](#static-statuses)Static Statuses [5.7.0+](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/5.7.0/CHANGELOG.md "Static storage of entry statuses was first available in version 5.7.0 of Craft.")

Craft’s powerful [events](docs_5x__extend__events.md) system allows developers to react to element updates, and connect author activity and content to other systems. Statuses, however, can be difficult to pin down—entries rely heavily on their **Post Date** and **Expiry Date** attributes to determine when an entry is returned, and what its “status” is at any given time.

Take this query that fetches blog articles:

```
{% set posts = craft.entries()
  .section('blog')
  .all() %}
```

Suppose we have an article with a **Post Date** five minutes in the future. Loading the page with this query *now* would not display the pending article; if we wait five minutes and refresh the page, the entry *does* show up… without any intervention by the author! This is because each query compares the server’s current time with entries’ stored `postDate` and `expiryDate` columns; depending on when you look at the data, Craft considers it to be in different statuses. Therein lies the issue: nothing *happens* when a pending entry “goes live” (or a live entry “expires”), so Craft can’t emit status-change events.

The [staticStatuses](docs_5x__reference__config__general.md#staticstatuses) config setting alters this behavior: instead of calculating statuses on-the-fly, Craft stores a static representation of an entry’s status at the time it is saved. Entry queries also use simplified conditions, matching against the stored values instead of date-based comparisons. In this mode, however, entries’ statuses only change when they are saved. The accompanying [`update-statuses` console command](docs_5x__reference__cli.md#update-statuses) provides a means of routinely checking and re-saving entries:

```
ddev craft update-statuses
```

If you opt in to static statuses, you must run this command with a tool like [cron  (opens new window)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) to ensure your content is published and expired in a reasonable amount of time.

In a [private plugin](docs_5x__extend__plugin-guide.md) or [custom module](docs_5x__extend__module-guide.md), you can [listen for save events  (opens new window)](https://craftcms.com/knowledge-base/handling-entry-saves) and check whether an entry received a new status:

```
use craft\base\Event;
use craft\elements\Entry;
use craft\events\ModelEvent;
use craft\helpers\ElementHelper;

Event::on(
    Entry::class,
    Entry::EVENT_AFTER_SAVE,
    function (ModelEvent $event) {
        /** @var Entry $entry */
        $entry = $event->sender;

        // Make sure we’re dealing with a canonical entry, and that there was indeed a status change:
        if (
            !ElementHelper::isDraftOrRevision($entry) &&
            $entry->getStatus() !== $entry->oldStatus
        ) {
            if ($entry->getStatus() === Entry::STATUS_LIVE) {
                // The entry just moved into the "live" status!
            } elseif ($entry->oldStatus === Entry::STATUS_LIVE) {
                // The entry *was* live, but isn’t any more!
            }
        }
    });
```

Depending on your editorial process, you will need to adjust the cases here to handle different transitions. Keep in mind that this handler may also run in response to normal entry saves (during an HTTP request) so it is advisable to offload any time- or resource-intensive operations to a [queue job](docs_5x__extend__queue-jobs.md).

## [#](#querying-entries)Querying Entries

When Craft receives a request matching an entry’s URI, it automatically makes an `entry` variable available. Everywhere else in your front-end (or PHP code), you can fetch entries using **entry queries**.

TwigPHP

```
{# Create a new entry query #}
{% set myEntryQuery = craft.entries() %}
```

```
// Create a new entry query
$myEntryQuery = \craft\elements\Entry::find();
```

Once you’ve created an entry query, you can set [parameters](#parameters) on it to narrow down the results, and then [execute it](docs_5x__development__element-queries.md#executing-element-queries) by calling `.one()` or `.all()` to return a single [Entry  (opens new window)](https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v5/craft-elements-entry.html) object or an array of them, respectively.

Nested entries *may* show up unexpectedly in some entry queries—particularly those that don’t filter by `.section()`. If you want to return only entries *without* owners, you can use `.section('*')`.  [5.2.0+](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/5.2.0/CHANGELOG.md "Querying for non-nested entries with the special “section wildcard” was first available in version 5.2.0 of Craft.")

### [#](#example)Example

We can display the 10 most recent entries in a “Blog” section by doing the following:

1. Create an entry query with `craft.entries()`.
2. Set the [section](#section) and [limit](#limit) parameters on it.
3. Fetch the entries with `.all()`.
4. Loop through the entries using a [for  (opens new window)](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/tags/for.html) tag to output the blog post HTML.

```
{# Create an entry query with the 'section' and 'limit' parameters #}
{% set myEntryQuery = craft.entries()
  .section('blog')
  .limit(10) %}

{# Fetch the entries #}
{% set entries = myEntryQuery.all() %}

{# Display the entries #}
{% for entry in entries %}
  <article>
    <h1><a href="{{ entry.url }}">{{ entry.title }}</a></h1>
    {{ entry.summary }}
    <a href="{{ entry.url }}">Continue reading</a>
