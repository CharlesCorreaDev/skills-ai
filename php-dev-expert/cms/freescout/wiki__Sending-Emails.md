## Introduction

Each mailbox in FreeScout has an **email address**. This email is set as a sender for all outgoing emails sent to customers and support agents.

There are 3 main approaches for sending emails:

- Send emails from the server where FreeScout is installed (via `PHP's mail() function` or `sendmail`).
- Set up your own SMTP server and use it to send emails (for example [Postal](https://github.com/atech/postal)).
- Use one of the [email delivery services](#email-delivery-services) (SendGrid, SendinBlue, Mailgun, etc) or [email service providers](#email-service-providers-esp) (Gmail, G Suite, Office 365, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.) to send emails. Popular email service providers do have some [limitations](#send-rate-limits-for-email-service-providers) on amount of emails sent per day, so keep this in mind.

## 1. FreeScout Email Sending Methods

**FreeScout** provides out of the box the following methods of sending emails to customers and support agents:

- `PHP's mail() function` — emails are sent directly from your server.
