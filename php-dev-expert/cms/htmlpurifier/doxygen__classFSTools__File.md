## Detailed Description

Represents a file in the filesystem.

**Warning:**
:   Be sure to distinguish between [get()](doxygen__classFSTools__File.md#a0b25c10279b67d191912e8de618aa64c "Retrieves the contents of a file.") and [write()](doxygen__classFSTools__File.md#a1f2b09ba999c32d267d58dccd83e8d19 "Writes contents to a file, creates new file if necessary.") versus [read()](doxygen__classFSTools__File.md#a2f5b634edd27233e746eb3e0b14077af "Retrieves an $length bytes of data from an open data.") and [put()](doxygen__classFSTools__File.md#a9ad26298312d0137e78da7dd1293157f "Writes to an open file."), the former operates on the entire file, while the latter operates on a handle.
