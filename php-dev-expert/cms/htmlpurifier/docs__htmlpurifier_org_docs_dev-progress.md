## CSS

| Name | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Standard | |
| --- | --- |
| background-color | COMPOSITE(<color>, transparent) |
| background | SHORTHAND, currently alias for background-color |
| border | SHORTHAND, MULTIPLE |
| border-color | MULTIPLE |
| border-style | MULTIPLE |
| border-width | MULTIPLE |
| border-\* | SHORTHAND |
| border-\*-color | COMPOSITE(<color>, transparent) |
| border-\*-style | ENUM(none, hidden, dotted, dashed, solid, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset) |
| border-\*-width | COMPOSITE(<length>, thin, medium, thick) |
| clear | ENUM(none, left, right, both) |
| color | <color> |
| float | ENUM(left, right, none), May require layout precautions with clear |
| font | SHORTHAND |
| font-family | CSS validator may complain if fallback font family not specified |
| font-size | COMPOSITE(<absolute-size>, <relative-size>, <length>, <percentage>) |
| font-style | ENUM(normal, italic, oblique) |
| font-variant | ENUM(normal, small-caps) |
| font-weight | ENUM(normal, bold, bolder, lighter, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900), maybe special code for in-between integers |
| letter-spacing | COMPOSITE(<length>, normal) |
| line-height | COMPOSITE(<number>, <length>, <percentage>, normal) |
| list-style-position | ENUM(inside, outside), Strange behavior in browsers |
| list-style-type | ENUM(...), Well-supported values are: disc, circle, square, decimal, lower-roman, upper-roman, lower-alpha and upper-alpha. See also CSS 3. Mostly IE lack of support. |
| list-style | SHORTHAND |
| margin | MULTIPLE |
| margin-\* | COMPOSITE(<length>, <percentage>, auto) |
| padding | MULTIPLE |
| padding-\* | COMPOSITE(<length>(positive), <percentage>(positive)) |
| text-align | ENUM(left, right, center, justify) |
| text-decoration | No blink (argh my eyes), not enum, can be combined (composite sorta): underline, overline, line-through |
| text-indent | COMPOSITE(<length>, <percentage>) |
| text-transform | ENUM(capitalize, uppercase, lowercase, none) |
| width | COMPOSITE(<length>, <percentage>, auto), Interesting |
| word-spacing | COMPOSITE(<length>, auto), IE 5 no support |
| Table | |
| --- | --- |
| border-collapse | ENUM(collapse, seperate) |
| border-space | MULTIPLE |
| caption-side | ENUM(top, bottom) |
| empty-cells | ENUM(show, hide), No IE support makes this useless, possible fix with &nbsp;? Unknown release milestone. |
| table-layout | ENUM(auto, fixed) |
| vertical-align | COMPOSITE(ENUM(baseline, sub, super, top, text-top, middle, bottom, text-bottom), <percentage>, <length>) Also applies to others with explicit height |
| Absolute positioning, unknown release milestone | |
| --- | --- |
| bottom | Dangerous, must be non-negative to even be considered, but it's still possible to arbitrarily position by running over. |
| left |
| right |
| top |
| clip | - |
| position | ENUM(static, relative, absolute, fixed) relative not absolute? |
| z-index | Dangerous |
| Unknown | |
| --- | --- |
| background-image | Dangerous |
| background-attachment | ENUM(scroll, fixed), Depends on background-image |
| background-position | Depends on background-image |
| cursor | Dangerous but fluffy |
| display | ENUM(...), Dangerous but interesting; will not implement list-item, run-in (Opera only) or table (no IE); inline-block has incomplete IE6 support and requires -moz-inline-box for Mozilla. Unknown target milestone. |
| height | Interesting, why use it? Unknown target milestone. |
| list-style-image | Dangerous? |
| max-height | No IE 5/6 |
| min-height |
| max-width |
| min-width |
| orphans | No IE support |
| widows | No IE support |
| overflow | ENUM, IE 5/6 almost (remove visible if set). Unknown target milestone. |
| page-break-after | ENUM(auto, always, avoid, left, right), IE 5.5/6 and Opera. Unknown target milestone. |
| page-break-before | ENUM(auto, always, avoid, left, right), Mostly supported. Unknown target milestone. |
| page-break-inside | ENUM(avoid, auto), Opera only. Unknown target milestone. |
| quotes | May be dropped from CSS2, fairly useless for inline context |
| visibility | ENUM(visible, hidden, collapse), Dangerous |
| white-space | ENUM(normal, pre, nowrap, pre-wrap, pre-line), Spotty implementation: pre (no IE 5/6), *nowrap* (no IE 5, supported), pre-wrap (only Opera), pre-line (no support). Fixable? Unknown target milestone. |
