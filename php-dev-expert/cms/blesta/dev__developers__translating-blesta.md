Language in Blesta is handled by a collection of language files, heretoafter referred to as a "language pack." Language packs are primarily located in the language directory /installdir/language/, but additional files may be located in various other locations includingÂ [Modules](dev__category__modules-1.md),Â [Payment Gateways](dev__category__payment-gateways.md), [Plugins](dev__category__plugins-1.md), and some components or helpers. The default language in Blesta is English, US located in **/installdir/language/en\_us/**.

Blesta includes many languages

Blesta ships with a number of languages from [github.com/blesta/language](https://github.com/blesta/language). These are full translations created through the DeepL AI Language Platform.

Why not place all language in a single directory?

Allowing Modules, Gateways, and Plugins to specify their own language packs allows for a simplified installation process and helps ensure users will successfully install third-party add-ons.

## Language Packs[â](#language-packs "Direct link to Language Packs")

Language packs must be named according to ISO 639-1 and 3166-1 standards. For example, English, US is stored in language pack en\_us. In addition to a collection of language files, each language pack must contain a file of the same name as its directory with a single line defining the name of the language in its native format.

/installdir/language/en\_us/en\_us

```
English, US
```

### Language Direction[â](#language-direction "Direct link to Language Direction")

Language direction may be defined in the app\_controller.php language file. This identifies which direction text should read (ltr for left-to-right, or rtl for right-to-left).

/installdir/language/en\_us/app\_controller.php

```
$lang['AppController.lang.dir'] = "ltr";
```

If not defined language will default to the "ltr" (left-to-right) direction.

## Anatomy of a Language File[â](#anatomy-of-a-language-file "Direct link to Anatomy of a Language File")

Each language file should correspond to the class name in which the language is used. Take for example /installdir/language/en\_us/admin\_clients.php. This file contains all language associated with the AdminClients controller and related views.

A language file may contain one or more language entries. Entries are represented by array key/value pairs that correspond to an index and definition, respectively.

/installdir/language/en\_us/admin\_clients.php

```
$lang['AdminClients.index.boxtitle_browseclients'] = "Browse Clients";
```

### Index Formats[â](#index-formats "Direct link to Index Formats")

Indexes are primarily comprised of three dot-segments. The two main formats are:

1. [ClassName].[methodName].[entry\_name]
2. [ClassName].[!error/!success/!notice].[entry\_name]

The exclamation point identifies an entry as not belonging to any particular method. This convention makes it easy to identify error, success, and notice messages that may be used by various methods.

### Variable Substitution[â](#variable-substitution "Direct link to Variable Substitution")

Some definitions contain variable substitutions, which can be identified by their syntax: %N$s, where N is a number (1, 2, ...). The $ in the variable name is escaped by a backslash () as the $ character has special meaning in double-quoted (") strings.

/installdir/language/en\_us/admin\_clients.php

```
$lang['AdminClients.!success.makepayment_processed'] = "The payment was successfully processed for %1\$s. Transaction Number: %2\$s"; // %1$s is the payment amount, %2$s is the transaction number
```

Variables can appear in any order

The definition above could easily have been written as "The payment was successfully processed! Transaction Number: %2$s, Amount: %1$s".

## Using Definitions[â](#using-definitions "Direct link to Using Definitions")

### Loading Language Files[â](#loading-language-files "Direct link to Loading Language Files")

Language files may be loaded from anywhere in Blesta. By default the Language library looks for language files in /installdir/language/, but you can override this value.

From somewhere in a controller or model

```
Language::loadLang("lang_file"); // loads from /installdir/language/[language_pack]/lang_file.php  
Language::loadLang("lang_file", null, PLUGINDIR . "my_plugin" . DS . "language" . DS); // loads from /installdir/plugins/my_plugin/language/[language_pack]/lang_file.php
```

### Displaying Definitions[â](#displaying-definitions "Direct link to Displaying Definitions")

Controllers and Models must invoke the Language library directly to access language definitions.

From somewhere in a controller or model

```
echo Language::_("ControllerName.methodName.entry_name");
```

Views have access to a wrapper method and should utilize the following syntax, instead:

From somewhere in a view

```
<?php $this->_("ControllerName.methodName.entry_name");?>
```

To set variables for substitution, add them beginning as the 3rd parameters to Language::*() or $this->*(). For example:

From somewhere in a view

```
<?php $this->_("ControllerName.methodName.entry_name", false, $param1, $param2, ..., $paramN);?>
```
