This document describes how to configure, connect to, and interact with the API. For information on expanding the API with your own custom code seeÂ Extending the API. All examples are presented using PHP.

Full Access â Trusted Applications Only

The Blesta API is fully open. Any valid API credentials grant access to **every public model method** in Blesta core *and* in installed plugins, modules, gateways, and other extensions â this should be treated as full administrative access to the installation.

Only use the API from fully trusted, first-party applications, and protect credentials accordingly. If you need a narrower, scoped, or purpose-built API for an untrusted client or third-party integration, build it as a plugin that exposes its own endpoint rather than calling the core API directly.

## Configuration[â](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

Before you begin using the API you must first create a set of API credentials for the company you wish to connect to. For information on creating API credentials consult the [System] > API Access section.

## Overview[â](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

### Structure[â](#structure "Direct link to Structure")

The structure of an API request involves specifying the model, method, and format to be requested, along with any additional parameters the method may require. For example:

```
https://yourdomain.com/installpath/api/users/get.json?user_id=1
```

In the above example, yourdomain.com is your domain and installpath is the path to the Blesta installation. If your server does not support `.htaccess` include index.php in your URL (e.g. /installpath/index.php/api/users/get.json?user\_id=1). users is the model to request, get is the method, and json is the format.

Requesting Models of Plugins

To request a specific model of a plugin format your request as /plugin.model/method.\*format\*

### Formats[â](#formats "Direct link to Formats")

The API supports XML, JSON, and PHP serialization formats. By default JSON formatting is used. So if there is an error detecting the format of the request (due to a bad URL, for example) the error response will be returned in JSON format.

### Errors[â](#errors "Direct link to Errors")

There are several types of errors that may be encountered when working with the API:

1. Sending invalid parameters will result in a 400 Bad Request response.

   ```
   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request  
   Content-Length: 137  
     
   {  
   "message":"The request cannot be fulfilled due to bad syntax.",  
   "errors":  
   {  
   "field":  
   {  
   "code":"Error message."  
   }  
   }  
   }
   ```
2. Providing invalid credentials will result in a 401 Unauthorized response.

   ```
   HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized  
   Content-Length: 67  
     
   {"message":"The authorization details given appear to be invalid."}
   ```
3. Attempting to access a resource that is not callable will result in a 403 Forbidden response.

   ```
   HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden  
   Content-Length: 55  
     
   {"message":"The requested resource is not accessible."}
   ```
4. Attempting to access a resource that does not exist will result in a 404 Not Found response.

   ```
   HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found  
   Content-Length: 52  
     
   {"message":"The requested resource does not exist."}
   ```
5. Requesting a format that is not supported will result in a 415 Unsupported Media Type response.

   ```
   HTTP/1.1 415 Unsupported Media Type  
   Content-Length: 66  
     
   {"message":"The format requested is not supported by the server."}
   ```
6. If an unexpected error occurs a 500 Internal Server Error will result. If this error is encountered consult the documentation for the method you are requesting.

   ```
   HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error  
   Content-Length: 42  
     
   {"message":"An unexpected error occured."}
   ```
7. If an unexpected error occurs that specifies that it "Failed to retrieve the default value" then you likely encounter this issue due to IonCube in Blesta. You can work-around this issue by ensuring that you specify all optional arguments to your API call.

   ```
   HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error  
   Content-Length: 108  
     
   {"message":"An unexpected error occured.","response":"Internal error: Failed to retrieve the default value"}
   ```
8. When Blesta is under maintenance mode, the API will return a 503 Service Unavailable response.

   ```
   HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable   
   Content-Length: 81   
     
   {"message":"The requested resource is currently unavailable due to maintenance."}
   ```

All error response objects contain an array of input parameters that produced errors. From the example above "field" is the parameter name. Each field may contain one or more error codes along with a related message. Common codes are empty, exists, format, length, and valid, but many more are available. The error code is always the index of the error message, and is used primarily in identifying the type of error encountered.

### Timestamps[â](#timestamps "Direct link to Timestamps")

The API returns all timestamps in UTC time using the following ISO 8601 format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss / 2021-12-31 12:00:00
```

The API expects timestamps in one of the following formats:

```
YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss Â±hh:mm / 2021-12-31 12:00:00 +00:00  
YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss UTC / 2021-12-31 12:00:00 UTC  
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ / 2021-12-31T12:00:00Z
```

Always specify a timezone

If the timezone can not be determined from the timestamp, the system will assume the timestamp is in local time. For this reason you should always specify a timezone in your timestamps. Localization settings can be found under [Settings] > [Company] > [General] > Localization.

Formatting dates with PHP

The easiest way to format a date into a suitable format using PHP is to use **date("c")**.

## Authentication[â](#authentication "Direct link to Authentication")

The API supports **Headers based key authentication (recommended)** and [Basic Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) and for web requests. When connecting to the API via a command line the API credentials must be passed as parameters. See [Using the Command Line Interface](dev__5__developers__api.md#locally) for more information on connecting to the API via command line.

### Authorization Headers[â](#authorization-headers "Direct link to Authorization Headers")

Include the following headers in your HTTP request

- `BLESTA-API-USER`
- `BLESTA-API-KEY`

Example with CURL:

**GET Request**

```
curl -X GET "https://yourdomain.com/api/users/get.json?user_id=1" \  
-H "BLESTA-API-USER: YOUR_API_USER_HERE" \  
-H "BLESTA-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

**POST Request**

```
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/users/get.json \  
-H "BLESTA-API-USER: YOUR_API_USER_HERE" \  
-H "BLESTA-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \  
-d "user_id=1"
```

#### Example in PHP[â](#example-in-php "Direct link to Example in PHP")

**GET Request**

```
<?php  
$ch = curl_init();  
  
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, 'https://yourdomain.com/api/users/get.json?user_id=1');  
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPGET, true);  
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [  
    'BLESTA-API-USER: YOUR_API_USER_HERE',  
    'BLESTA-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'  
]);  
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);  
  
$response = curl_exec($ch);  
curl_close($ch);  
  
echo $response;  
?>
```

**POST Request**

```
<?php  
$ch = curl_init();  
  
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, 'https://yourdomain.com/api/users/get.json');  
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);  
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [  
    'BLESTA-API-USER: YOUR_API_USER_HERE',  
    'BLESTA-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'  
]);  
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, 'user_id=1');  
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);  
  
$response = curl_exec($ch);  
curl_close($ch);  
  
echo $response;  
?>
```

### HTTP Basic Auth[â](#http-basic-auth "Direct link to HTTP Basic Auth")

Running PHP in CGI or FCGId mode?

Update your .htaccess file to pass an environment variable to Blesta so it can capture the basic authentication details as per the following snippet:

**.htaccess**

```
RewriteEngine on  
...  
RewriteRule .\* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
```

If running PHP-FPM, set CGIPassAuth On in your .htaccess, or within your `httpd.conf` like the example:

```
    <FilesMatch \.php$>  
        CGIPassAuth On  
        SetHandler proxy:unix:/var/php-fpm/166630281728629.sock|fcgi://127.0.0.1  
    </FilesMatch>
```

## Connecting[â](#connecting "Direct link to Connecting")

There are a number of ways to connect to the API. Choose the option that best fits your environment.

### Remotely with HTTP Basic Auth (See examples above for Recommended Authorization Headers)[â](#remotely-with-http-basic-auth-see-examples-above-for-recommended-authorization-headers "Direct link to Remotely with HTTP Basic Auth (See examples above for Recommended Authorization Headers)")

To connect remotely, first determine the URL of the API for your installation. The default path is [http://yourdomain.com/installpath/api/.](http://yourdomain.com/installpath/index.php/api/.) Where yourdomain.com is the domain you've installed Blesta in, and installpath is the path to Blesta. If your server does not [support .htaccess](dev__display__user__Installing_Blesta.md) then the URL should instead appear asÂ [http://yourdomain.com/installpath/index.php/api/.](http://yourdomain.com/installpath/api/.)

Safety First!

Because each request contains your API key, and may contain additional sensitive information, you should only process requests remotely over a secure connection (i.e. only use HTTPS)

Download the API SDK

The [SDK](https://github.com/phillipsdata/blesta_sdk) includes an API processor that makes it super easy to work with the API.Â **The SDK was updated on Nov 5, 2025 to add support for Header Based Authentication, PHP 8.1+, as well as including some additional examples**

**Connecting Remotely with PHP**

```
<?php  
require_once "blesta_api.php";  
  
$user = "username";  
$key = "key";  
$url = "https://yourdomain.com/installpath/api/";  
  
$api = new BlestaApi($url, $user, $key);  
  
$response = $api->get("users", "get", array('user_id' => 1));  
  
print_r($response->response());  
print_r($response->errors());  
?>
```

**Connecting Remotely with cURL**

```
curl https://yourdomain.com/installpath/api/users/get.json?user_id=1 -u username:key
```

### Locally[â](#locally "Direct link to Locally")

#### Using the Command Line Interface[â](#using-the-command-line-interface "Direct link to Using the Command Line Interface")

The API is available via a command line interface (CLI). The API supports the following command line parameters:

1. `-u` or `-user` The API user
2. `-k` or `-key` The API key
3. `-m` or `-method` The method for the request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
4. `-p` or `-params` A URL encoded array of parameters as you would find in a URL string (e.g. first\_name=John&last\_name=Doe&company=Acme Co.)

Remember to quote parameters

If any of your command line parameters contain special characters or spaces you **must** wrap quote marks (') around the value.

**Below is an example API request.**

```
php index.php api/users/get.json -u USER -k KEY -m GET -p "user_id=1"
```

#### Within the Blesta environment[â](#within-the-blesta-environment "Direct link to Within the Blesta environment")

If you're working with or have created code within the Blesta environment, there's no need to use the API at all. All of the methods available in the API are first and foremost available to Blesta, in the form of models. To use these models, simply load the model within your environment.

**Loading Models from a Controller**

```
// from somewhere in your controller...  
$this->uses(array("ModelName"));  
  
// Now invoke it  
$this->ModelName->someMethod($param1, $param2);
```

**Loading Models elsewhere**

```
// from any other class...  
Loader::loadModels($this, array("ModelName"));  
  
// Now invoke it  
$this->ModelName->someMethod($param1, $param2);
```

## HTTP Verbs[â](#http-verbs "Direct link to HTTP Verbs")

The API encourages the proper use of `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` when interacting with the API. For all POST requests the API will pass only post parameters to the requested resource. For PUT only put parameters will be passed. Similarly, for all `GET` and `DELETE` requests, the API will pass only get parameters to the requested resource.

Choose the Request Type Carefully

It is highly discouraged to use `GET` or `DELETE` for API requests where you are providing sensitive information. That sensitive information will be included as plain-text as get parameters in the URI. Instead, use POST or PUT to pass that sensitive information securely in the request body rather than the URI.

### POST[â](#post "Direct link to POST")

Use `POST` requests when creating new records. For example, when adding a new user record via *api/users/add.json*.

### GET[â](#get "Direct link to GET")

Use `GET` requests when retrieving record data. For example, when fetching a user record via *api/users/get.json*.

### PUT[â](#put "Direct link to PUT")

Use `PUT` requests when updating records. For example, when updating a user record via *api/users/edit.json*.

### DELETE[â](#delete "Direct link to DELETE")

Use `DELETE` requests when deleting records. For example, when deleting a user record via *api/users/delete.json*.

## Requests[â](#requests "Direct link to Requests")

The API supports hundreds of requests, and many more through API extensions, so we can't document them all here. Instead, check out the [source code documentation](https://source-docs.blesta.com/packages/blesta-app-models.html). All public model methods are callable through the API. To find documentation on a particular request pull up the related model and method from the source code documentation.

### How to Read the Source Docs[â](#how-to-read-the-source-docs "Direct link to How to Read the Source Docs")

The [source code documentation](https://source-docs.blesta.com/packages/blesta-app-models.html) contains documentation on everything in Blesta, but the API only supports calling Model methods. You can find all core model methods under [blesta > app > models](https://source-docs.blesta.com/packages/blesta-app-models.html), however plugin model methods are also callable through the API.
