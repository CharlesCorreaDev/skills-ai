## Overview

A newsletter is an email you compose and send to a schedule's audience: its followers, its email subscribers, its ticket buyers, or a list of your own. Open **Newsletters** in the sidebar. Newsletters are on every plan, with a [monthly allowance](#allowance) that counts recipients.

Newsletters are for a schedule's owner and its admins. A team member with view-only access does not see the schedule here. On eventschedule.com an admin also needs the schedule to be on the Enterprise plan, which is the plan that includes [team access](docs__managing-schedules.md#team).

The section is one page with four tabs, which become a dropdown on a phone. **Create Newsletter** sits at the end of the title row on every tab. If you manage more than one schedule, a schedule picker sits beside it: each schedule has its own newsletters, segments and templates, and changing schedule keeps you on the tab you are on.

| Tab | What it holds | Described under |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Newsletters | Every newsletter of the schedule, with its status, recipients, open rate and click rate | [Managing Newsletters](#managing) |
| Segments | The saved audiences a newsletter can go to, and the form that adds one | [Managing Segments](#managing-segments) |
| Templates | Designs you saved, to start a newsletter from | [Saving Your Own Templates](#saved-templates) |
| Import Emails | Addresses you already have, typed, pasted or uploaded into a segment | [Importing Emails](#importing-emails) |

The builder lays out your email as a stack of content blocks with a live preview beside it, and audience segments decide who receives it. A newsletter never sends itself: you compose it and choose when it goes. Two other kinds of mail do leave on their own, and neither spends your allowance: the automatic new-event digest to confirmed email subscribers, and the emails people on an event's interest list signed up for. [Recipients & Segments](#recipients) sets out who is on which list.

### Monthly Allowance

The allowance counts **individual recipients, not newsletters**. One newsletter sent to 100 followers uses 100 of the allowance, so on the Free plan a single send reaches at most 10 people.

| Plan | Newsletter emails per month |
| --- | --- |
| Free | 10 |
| Pro | 100 |
| Enterprise | 1,000 |
| Selfhosted | Unlimited |
| Any plan with its own email settings | Unlimited |

Connect your own mail server in the [Email Settings](docs__creating-schedules.md#integrations-email) row of the schedule's Integrations tab and the cap is lifted for that schedule, because the messages leave through your provider and not ours.

While a schedule has a limit, a meter reads "5 of 100 newsletter emails sent this month" with what remains: beside the opening line of the Newsletters tab, and at the end of the title row on the Create and Edit pages. Test sends are excluded from the count. Sending is checked against the whole recipient list up front: if a send would push you past the limit it is refused outright, never delivered in part, so trim the segment or upgrade first.

## Newsletter Builder

Click **Create Newsletter** to open the builder. The page has a link back to **Newsletters** above its title and the allowance meter at the end of the title row. When the schedule has saved templates, a **Start from a template** card comes first. The editing panel is split into three tabs, with a live preview pinned beside it on wide screens, and a bar along the foot of the page holds what saves and sends it.

Open full size](https://eventschedule.com/images/docs/newsletters--create-dark.png)

### Content

The subject line (required), who the newsletter goes to, the preview text and the block list. The **To** line under the subject names the audience and how many people are in it; **Change** opens the recipients on the Settings tab. **Preview text** is the line an inbox shows after the subject; leave it empty and it is the opening of your first text block. **Add Block** opens the block palette, which says where a new block will go: after the block that is open, or at the end when none is. Click a block in the palette to add it, or drag it to a place in the list. Each block's line has **Move up**, **Move down**, duplicate and remove; a removed block can be put back with **Undo** in the bar for a few seconds. Blocks can also be dragged by their handle.

#### Style

The [design](#templates) picker, the colour, font and button settings described under [Style Customization](#style-customization), and **Save as Template**.

#### Settings

Recipients (everyone, or the [segments](#recipients) you choose), [A/B testing](#ab-testing), and the footer text that replaces your schedule name at the bottom of the email.

### The Bar Along the Foot

| Button | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Send a Test | Emails the newsletter as it is on screen to you, or to your schedule's contact address. See [Sending](#sending) |
| Save | Saves the draft without leaving the page: the tab you are on, the open block and the preview stay as they were |
| Review and send | Saves the draft and opens a last look before anything goes: the subject, who it goes to and how many, and what is left of the month's allowance, with the choice to send now or schedule it |

The bar says when something has not been saved yet, and the browser asks before you leave the page with unsaved changes. If a save is refused (a subject left empty, say), the bar says why and the builder opens the tab to fix it.

Tip

The preview refreshes as you type and renders the same HTML your recipients receive, and it keeps its place while it does. Opening a block brings it into view in the preview and outlines it; clicking a block in the preview opens it for editing. **Desktop** and **Mobile** above it switch between a desktop width and a phone's, which is where most mail is opened. On a phone the preview is a fourth tab that opens over the editor. A new newsletter starts from your most recent one's design, style settings and selected segments, so a house style only has to be set up once. Its preview text does not come along, because that line was written for one mail.

## Block Types

Build your newsletter by combining these content blocks. A new newsletter starts with your profile image and header banner (when your schedule has them), a heading, two text blocks, an events block and your social links, all of which you can remove.

### Content Blocks

#### Heading

Large text for section titles and headlines. While the first heading is empty or the same as the subject line, it copies the subject as you type it. Once you type in the heading itself, it keeps your wording.

**Fields:** Heading Text, Heading Level (Header, Subheader or Section), Alignment (left, center or right)

#### Text

A paragraph of Markdown, written in the same editor used elsewhere in the admin panel, with a toolbar for bold, italics, lists and links.

**Fields:** Content

#### Events

Pulls in your events, each with its day, time, price (or Free, or Sold Out) and a link to its page. The Cards layout adds each event's flyer in the designs that show pictures (Modern, Classic and Bold), and in those three it opens with the first event as a larger card; the List layout is text only in every design. Left on All upcoming events (auto) it lists up to ten upcoming or ongoing events in date order, a recurring event under its next date that has not begun; hand-picked events are shown in date order too. Either way it never includes drafts, cancelled events, unlisted events, password-protected ones, an event your schedule has not accepted, or one that has ended, and a link to your full schedule follows the list. An event people sign up for, or whose tickets can no longer be bought, is listed without a price.

**Fields:** All upcoming events (auto) or a hand-picked list of events, Event Layout (cards or list)

#### Button

Call-to-action button. It picks up the accent colour and corner style from the Style tab.

**Fields:** Button Text, Button URL, Alignment

#### Image

One or more images, each with its own caption and link. Uploading a file requires a Pro plan 

Pro
 - Requires the Pro plan
; on the Free plan you can still point the block at an image URL you host elsewhere. Uploads accept JPG, PNG, GIF and WebP up to 10 MB.

**Fields:** Image URL or upload, Alt text, Caption, Link, Width, Alignment, and Layout (column, row or grid) once there is more than one image

#### Video

Email clients cannot play video, so this block shows the YouTube thumbnail with a play badge and links out to the video. Standard watch links, youtu.be links and Shorts links are all recognised.

**Fields:** YouTube URL

#### Quote

Styled blockquote with attribution, for testimonials or press pull-quotes.

**Fields:** Quote Text, Author, Author Title

#### Sponsors

Your [sponsor logos](docs__creating-schedules.md#sponsors), under the section title you set on the schedule. The block shows them even while the sponsors section is switched off on your pages: a block is something you placed in this newsletter.

**Fields:** Sponsor Source (from your schedule settings, or from the first event in the newsletter)

#### Poll

Shows the first active poll found across your upcoming events. Each answer links through to that event's page, where the vote is cast. It has no fields to fill in, and renders nothing if no upcoming event has an active poll.

### Layout & Utility Blocks

#### Divider

Horizontal line to visually separate sections.

**Fields:** Divider Style (solid, dashed or dotted)

#### Spacer

Adjustable vertical gap between blocks.

**Fields:** Spacer Height, 5 to 200 pixels

#### Social Links

Icons linking to your profiles. The block is pre-filled from the website and social links on your schedule, and each row can be edited or removed.

**Fields:** Platform and URL per link

### Auto-populated Blocks

#### Profile Image

Your schedule's profile image, centred. As the first block it becomes the masthead: the logo with your schedule's name, set the way the chosen design sets it. No fields: change the image on the schedule and every newsletter follows.

#### Header Banner

Your schedule's header image across the email: edge to edge in Modern, Classic and Bold, within the margins in Minimal and Compact. Also has no fields.

Tip

Leave the **Events** block on "All upcoming events (auto)" and a cloned newsletter always goes out with the current schedule, with no block editing between sends.

## Templates

The **Style** tab opens with the five built-in designs, under **Design**. Picking one rewrites the colour, font and button settings in a single click; your blocks, your footer text, your preview text and the layout chosen on the Events block are left alone, so you can try designs on a finished draft without losing work. If the colours you are replacing were your own, **Undo** beside the picker brings them back for a few seconds.

| Preset | Background | Accent | Font | Buttons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Modern | White | Your schedule's accent colour | System | Rounded |
| Classic | Warm off-white | Brown | Georgia | Square |
| Minimal | White | Near black | System | Rounded |
| Bold | Near-black navy | Red | System | Rounded |
| Compact | Light grey | Green | Trebuchet MS | Square |

Every value stays editable afterwards, so a preset is a starting point rather than a lock-in. A preset is also a layout of its own, which stays whatever colours you give it: Modern is a rounded sheet with the title on a band of your accent colour, Classic a framed page with a nameplate and outlined buttons, Minimal a bare page of text links, Bold heavy type on a page that starts dark, and Compact a tight digest. System is the reader's own interface font (San Francisco, Segoe UI or Roboto, whichever their device has).

### Saving Your Own Templates

Once a design works, keep it. A saved template stores the blocks, the preset and the style settings under a name of your choosing. There are two ways to make one:

- On the **Style** tab of the builder, click **Save as Template** and give it a name. The newsletter is saved first, so the template holds what is on screen
- On the **Templates** tab of the Newsletters section, click **Create Template** to build one from scratch in the same builder

The Templates tab shows each template as a card with the colours it was saved with, its name, its preset and the day it was made. **Use** starts a new newsletter from it, **Edit** reopens it in the builder, and **Delete** removes it after asking. Newsletters already made from a template are not affected. Whenever the schedule has at least one template, the **Start from a template** card at the top of the Create Newsletter page offers them too.

A template has no subject line and no recipients: those belong to the newsletter you create from it, so the template builder has no Settings tab.

## Style Customization

Below the preset picker, the **Style Settings** panel controls the whole email. Each colour has both a swatch picker and a hex field.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Background Color | The background behind the email body |
| Accent Color | Buttons, links and highlighted elements. Defaults to your schedule's accent colour |
| Text Color | Default colour for body text |
| Font Family | System (the reader's own interface font), Arial, Georgia, Verdana, Trebuchet MS or Courier New |
| Button Style | Rounded or square corners on buttons |
| Footer Text | On the Settings tab. Replaces the schedule name printed above the unsubscribe link |

The layout of the Events block is not a global setting: choose cards or list on the block itself.

Note

Email clients have varying CSS support, so the builder renders to table-based, inline-styled HTML with a small set of email-safe fonts. That is why the font list is short and why there is no free-form CSS here. Whatever three colours you pick, the builder works out the rest (panels, hairlines, quieter text, the label on a button) so the text stays readable, and it asks mail apps to keep your colours in a reader's dark mode. Some recolour a mail anyway, so send yourself a test. Free schedules also carry a small "Powered by Event Schedule" line under the unsubscribe link; upgrading to Pro removes it.

## Email Subscribers

Signing up asks for nothing but a name and an email address. A signed-out visitor can give your schedule an address directly, and those people become your **email subscribers**. They appear in their own list on the [Followers tab](docs__managing-schedules.md#followers), separately from account holders who pressed Follow while signed in. Confirming an address given through the sign-up form also sets up an account for them that follows your schedule, so they are listed once, under Email subscribers, with an Account badge. They can choose a password on the confirmation page itself, or any time afterwards from the **Manage your account** link in the footer of anything you send them. An address collected at checkout is already confirmed and does not create one, unless the buyer asked for an account on the ticket form itself.

### Where People Sign Up

#### The sign-up panel

A short form on your schedule page and on each event page. Signing up here sends a confirmation email, and the address joins your audience only once that link is clicked. It is on unless you turn off **Show Sign-Up Panel** in the [Mailing list](docs__creating-schedules.md#engagement-mailing-list) row of the schedule's Engagement tab, and your sign-up link opens it either way.

#### At checkout

A tick box on the ticket and RSVP forms, off by default. Because the same address is already receiving a ticket, no confirmation email is needed and the person joins straight away.

#### The Follow button

On eventschedule.com, a signed-out visitor who presses Follow gets the same short form in a pop-up, asking for a name and an email address. It sends the same confirmation email as the sign-up panel.

#### Your sign-up link

The Followers tab gives you a shareable link and a QR code that open your schedule with the form ready. Useful on a poster, a flyer or a merch table.

#### Your own website

The same form, embedded on your website with a short snippet from the Followers tab. It sends the same confirmation email, and people who sign up there carry a Website badge. See [Embedding a Signup Form](docs__sharing.md#embed-subscribe-form).

### Automatic New-Event Emails

This is the promise made to people when they sign up, and it is kept for you. When you publish new events, your confirmed subscribers are sent a single short digest listing them.

- One digest covering every event in the batch, never one email per event, listing up to 25 of them, soonest first
- At most one every 72 hours per schedule, however often you publish
- Only public events. Drafts, internal, unlisted and password-protected events are never announced
- Only events your schedule created. An event another schedule created and lists on yours, such as a venue's show naming you as the act, is not included
- Only events still to come. Back-filling past dates sends nothing
- Every digest carries a one-click unsubscribe link

Turn it off per schedule with **Email subscribers about new events**, in the [Notifications](docs__creating-schedules.md#settings-notifications) row of the schedule's Settings tab. Account followers are not included: they are reached by a newsletter you compose and send. On eventschedule.com the digest follows the same [verification rule](#verification) as newsletters, so a schedule with more than 50 confirmed subscribers needs its own email settings or a verified phone number, or those events are not announced.

Confirmed subscribers only

Someone who signed up through the panel but never clicked the confirmation link is shown as **Awaiting confirmation** and is never emailed. That is deliberate: it stops anyone signing up an address they do not own. It also means the number of subscribers on the Followers tab can be higher than the recipient count on a newsletter.

## Recipients & Segments

The **Recipients** panel on the Settings tab offers two choices. The first is everyone: your followers and your [email subscribers](#email-subscribers) together, which is where a new newsletter starts. The second, **Chosen segments**, lists your saved segments with a live recipient count beside each one; tick as many as you need and the lists are merged. With none ticked the newsletter still goes to everyone, and the panel says so. Under the choices, and under the subject on the Content tab, the **To** line names who the newsletter will reach and how many people that is.

### Three Lists, Three Kinds of Mail

Three lists of people can hear from your schedule by email, and only two of them can be sent a newsletter:

| List | How someone joins | What reaches them automatically | Newsletters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Email subscribers | Gives a name and email address on your schedule or event page and confirms it, or ticks the box at checkout | The new-event digest, at most one every 72 hours | Yes, through the Email subscribers segment or the default send |
| Account followers | Presses Follow while signed in on eventschedule.com, or submits an event through your curator submission form (the form says so) | Nothing | Yes, through the All Followers segment or the default send |
| An event's interest list | Leaves an email address on one event page, under "Tell me when tickets go on sale" or "Tell me if anything changes" (the “Notify me” card, where the schedule has switched it on) | That event's on-sale email, a reminder shortly before it starts, a cancellation notice, and any notice you choose to send if the date or venue changes | No. No segment reaches it, and its emails do not count against your allowance |

The interest list belongs to one event and ends with it. See [the interest list](docs__tickets.md#interest-list) in Selling Tickets.

### Segment Types

#### All Followers

Account holders who pressed Follow on your schedule and have not opted out of emails. Confirmed email subscribers are left out even though confirming gives them an account, so add the Email subscribers segment, or tick nothing, to reach both. Learn how to [build your follower base](docs__sharing.md#followers).

#### Email subscribers

Everyone who confirmed the sign-up form, plus buyers who ticked the box at checkout. An address still awaiting confirmation is never included. See [Email Subscribers](#email-subscribers).

#### Ticket Buyers

Everyone who has bought a ticket or registered for one of your events, taken from the email on the order, including guests who booked an appointment and orders later cancelled or refunded. Optionally narrow it to a single event. See [Selling Tickets](docs__tickets.md).

#### Manual

A list of addresses you supply, either typed in or bulk [imported](#importing-emails). Useful for a curated press or partner list.

#### Waitlist

People currently on a [waitlist](docs__tickets.md#waitlist), either waiting or already notified, including the free RSVP waitlist. Available on every plan, and can be narrowed to a single event.

#### Sub-schedule

Ticket buyers from events filed under one sub-schedule, for category-specific promotions. The option only appears once the schedule has at least one sub-schedule.

### Who Actually Receives It

- Addresses are matched case-insensitively and de-duplicated, so someone in two segments is emailed once and counts once against your allowance
- Anyone who has unsubscribed from this schedule is removed, as is anyone who has turned off emails on their account
- Every recipient is resolved at send time, so a follower who joins after you draft the newsletter is still included

Schedule members are always included

Team members on the schedule (the owner, admins and viewers) whose email is verified and who have not turned off emails always receive every newsletter, whichever segments are selected. This keeps the team in the loop on what is being sent. They count against the monthly allowance like anyone else.

## Managing Segments

Segments are reusable, so build them once and pick them from the Settings tab on every future newsletter. They live on the **Segments** tab of the Newsletters section, which the **Manage Segments** link in the builder also opens. The tab lists the schedule's segments first, each with its type and its current recipient count, and the **Create Segment** form sits under the list.

### Creating a Segment

1. Open the **Segments** tab
2. Under **Create Segment**, enter a name
3. Choose the type: All Followers, Email subscribers, Ticket Buyers, Manual, Waitlist or Sub-schedule (listed once the schedule has a sub-schedule). A line under the choice says who that type reaches
4. Fill in whatever the type asks for next: an optional event filter for Ticket Buyers and Waitlist, the sub-schedule for Sub-schedule, or the address list for Manual (one per line, with an optional name after a comma)
5. Click **Create Segment**

### Editing and Deleting

**Edit**, or the segment's name, opens the segment's own page, with a link back to **Segments** above its title. There you can rename it and see its type, its recipient count and the day it was made. A Ticket Buyers or Waitlist segment can be narrowed to another event, or to all events, and a Sub-schedule segment pointed at another sub-schedule; the type itself is chosen when the segment is created, so to change it, create a new segment. Renaming a segment leaves its event or sub-schedule as it was.

Under that, the page lists the people in the segment. On a manual segment you can add one by name and email under **Add Subscriber**, correct an entry in place, or delete it, and **Import emails in bulk** opens the Import Emails tab. Every other type is worked out afresh each time, so its list is read-only and shows the first 50 recipients.

**Delete** asks first. A segment that is still attached to a draft or scheduled newsletter cannot be deleted: detach it there first, then delete.

## Importing Emails

Bring an existing mailing list across on the **Import Emails** tab of the Newsletters section. Up to 10,000 addresses can be imported at a time, on every plan.

### Choosing a Segment

The first card, **Select segment**, decides where the contacts land: **Create new segment** with a name you provide, or **Add to existing segment**. Imports always go into a manual segment, so only manual segments appear in that dropdown, and the second choice is offered only once the schedule has one.

### Import Methods

The second card has a tab for each way in. **Paste Emails** and **Upload CSV** both end by filling the **Form Entry** rows, where you can still correct them, and **Confirm Import** there is what saves.

#### Form Entry

Type contacts in row by row with name and email. The email is required, the name is optional. Best for small lists or one-off additions.

#### Paste Emails

Paste a block of text and click **Parse Emails**. One address per line, `Name <email>`, comma-separated addresses and "email, name" pairs are all understood.

#### Upload CSV

Drop in a CSV of up to 10 MB, then map each column to Email, Name or Skip. The importer guesses the mapping and shows a preview with the row count before anything is saved. **Next** carries the rows to Form Entry.

Whichever method you use, the rows are validated first and any bad or duplicate address is reported by row number so you can fix it before confirming. Addresses already in the target segment are skipped, not duplicated. After a successful import you land on the Segments tab, with a message saying how many addresses were added.

Only import people who agreed to hear from you

Importing adds each address to the segment and nothing else: no account is created for anyone, and nobody is added to your followers. You are responsible for having their permission to email them, and every recipient counts against your monthly allowance.

## Sending

**Review and send** in the bar saves the newsletter and opens a last look before anything goes out. It names the subject and the preview text, who the newsletter goes to and how many people that is (each address counted once, after unsubscribes), and how much of the month's [allowance](#allowance) will be left. If the newsletter cannot go (the allowance is spent, nobody is in the chosen segments, or a [verification](#verification) is needed), it says so there, with a link to what fixes it, instead of after you press send.

### Send Now

The newsletter moves to Sending. Messages go out in small batches a few seconds apart rather than all at once, so a large send takes a few minutes to finish. While it is going out, its row on the Newsletters tab and its statistics say how many have been sent so far, and update themselves.

#### Schedule for later

Pick a future date and time. The dialog names the timezone it is read in: your own, or your schedule's when your profile has none. The send fires within a minute of that time. A notice at the top of the edit page shows the scheduled time and offers **Cancel Schedule**, which returns it to Draft.

#### Send a Test

Saves the newsletter and sends one copy to you, or to your schedule's contact email address; the dialog lets you choose and says when it has gone. Test sends do not count against your monthly allowance and are excluded from the statistics, and there is a short cooling-off period between tests. Send one before every real send: images, links and dark-mode rendering are the three things that most often look different in a real inbox from the builder preview. **Send a test first** in Review and send opens the same dialog.

### Verification Above 50 Recipients

On eventschedule.com, a newsletter going to more than 50 recipients needs either [your own email settings](docs__creating-schedules.md#integrations-email) on the schedule or a [verified phone number](docs__account-settings.md#profile) in your profile. Up to 50 recipients it goes out without either, and so does a test. Until you have one, a notice on the Newsletters tab and in the builder says so and links to both, and a larger send, whether now or scheduled, is refused. The automatic new-event digest follows the same rule. Selfhosted installs are not affected.

Selfhosted: give the queue a real driver

With the `sync` queue driver an immediate send of more than 50 recipients is refused, because the whole delivery would have to happen inside one web request. Either schedule the newsletter instead or configure a background queue driver and a worker. See the [selfhost installation guide](docs__selfhost__installation.md).

## A/B Testing

An A/B test sends two versions of one newsletter, variant A and variant B, to a small sample of your audience, waits, and then sends the version that did better to everyone else. Open the **A/B Testing** panel on the Settings tab of a newsletter.

### Setting Up a Test

1. Click **Create A/B Test** to open the form
2. Under **Field to Test**, choose what the two versions will differ in: **Subject** or **Content Above Events**
3. Set **Sample Size (%)**, from 5 to 50 (20 by default), and **Wait Hours**, from 1 to 72 (4 by default)
4. Under **Winner Criteria**, choose **Open Rate** or **Click Rate**
5. Click **Create A/B Test** under the form. Your newsletter is saved and becomes variant A, and a copy is created as variant B, which opens for editing so you can make the change you want to test

From then on each variant's A/B Testing panel says which one it is, what is being tested, and links to the other variant. On the Newsletters tab variant B is listed under variant A, each with an A or B chip. A newsletter can belong to one test only, and a test always has exactly two variants. Variant B goes to the same people as variant A, so its Settings tab has no recipients of its own: the test splits one audience.

### Sending the Test

On a variant the bar's last button is **Send A/B test**. It opens the same last look as any newsletter, and says what will happen: how many people get variant A and variant B now, and that after the wait the variant with the better open or click rate goes to everyone else. The sample is drawn at random from variant A's audience and split between the two. Either variant can send the test, and it goes out once.

A variant is never sent on its own, now or scheduled: that would mail the whole audience one version, and the other one again later. The whole audience counts against your allowance, as one newsletter would.

Selfhosted: a test needs a real queue

The winner is picked by a background job that waits for the hours you set. With the `sync` queue driver that wait cannot happen, so an A/B test is refused there, and Review and send says so. Configure a background queue driver and a worker first. See the [selfhost installation guide](docs__selfhost__installation.md).

### Comparing the Results

Once a variant is sending or sent, its [statistics](#analytics) page carries an **A/B Test Results** card with both variants side by side: the subject, the sent count, the open rate and the click rate of each. The comparison needs enough recipients to mean anything: on a list of a few dozen people the difference between variants is usually noise.

## Analytics

Once a newsletter is sending or sent, its subject on the Newsletters tab, and the **Stats** link at the end of its row, open its statistics page. The page is titled with the newsletter's subject, says when it was sent, and has a link back to **Newsletters** above the title. **View email** beside the title shows the newsletter as it reads, drawn again from what was saved, so its events are the ones that stand today; **Clone** starts a new draft from it. The list itself also carries sortable Recipients, Open Rate and Click Rate columns.

| Metric | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Sent | How many messages were delivered to the mail server |
| Opens | Recipients who opened the email, and that as a percentage of sent |
| Clicks | Recipients who clicked at least one link, and that as a percentage of sent |
| Failed | Messages the mail server rejected or could not deliver |
| Unsubscribed | People who unsubscribed from your schedule through this newsletter's link, and that as a percentage of sent |
| Opens Over Time, Clicks Over Time | Two charts plotting activity by day since the send |
| Top Clicked Links | The ten most-clicked destinations, with their click counts |
| Recipients | A sortable list of every recipient, 50 to a page, with their name, email address, status, and when they opened and clicked |

Opens are measured with a tracking pixel, so a recipient whose client blocks remote images counts as unopened even if they read the email. Treat the open rate as a floor and a trend rather than an exact number. Clicks are counted by routing each link through a redirect, which is also why link addresses in the delivered email look different from the ones you typed.

Newsletter traffic shows up in schedule analytics too

Links are tagged as newsletter traffic on their way out, so visits arriving from a send appear under traffic sources in [Analytics](docs__analytics.md#web-analytics). That is how you tell what a newsletter did after the click, not just up to it.

## Managing Newsletters

The **Newsletters** tab lists every newsletter of the selected schedule, 20 to a page: its subject, its status with the time it was or will be sent, once it has gone out its recipients, open rate and click rate, and the day it was created. Click a column heading to sort by it; the newest are first until you do. The subject opens the builder for a draft or a scheduled newsletter and the statistics for one that is sending or sent, and the links at the end of the row are **Edit** or **Stats**, **Clone** and **Delete**. With more than one schedule, the picker at the end of the title row switches between them.

### Draft

In progress, not sent or scheduled. Editable at any time.

#### Scheduled

Queued for a future time. Still editable, and **Cancel Schedule** on the edit page puts it back to Draft.

#### Sending

Delivery is under way. It cannot be edited or deleted while in this state, and statistics are already available.

#### Sent

Delivered. Open its statistics, or clone it to start the next one.

### Cloning

**Clone** copies the blocks, style (preview text included, so rewrite it for the new send) and recipients into a fresh draft and opens it, leaving the original untouched. Statistics and any A/B test are not carried over. This is the quickest way to run a recurring digest.

### Deleting

**Delete** asks first, then removes the newsletter from the list. A newsletter that is currently sending has no Delete link; wait for it to finish.

### Unsubscribes

Every newsletter footer carries an unsubscribe link. One click opts that address out and it is excluded from every future send for that schedule, automatically and with no work from you. Unsubscribes are per schedule, so someone who leaves one of your schedules still hears from the others. Recipients can also turn off all email from their own account settings, which removes them everywhere.
