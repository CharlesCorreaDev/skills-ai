4. **Disable the cache:** Modify the `settings/settings.ini.php` file to disable caching.

```
'templatecache' => false,  
'templatecompile' => false,  
'modulecompile' => false
```

5. **Update database settings:** Update the database settings in the `settings/settings.ini.php` file.

```
'db' =>  
    array (  
      'host' => '<host>',  
      'user' => '<username>',  
      'password' => '<password>',

## Should I export the `lh_chat_online_user` footprint table as well?[​](#should-i-export-the-lh_chat_online_user-footprint-table-as-well "Direct link to should-i-export-the-lh_chat_online_user-footprint-table-as-well")

No, it is not necessary. The table will be populated again. You will only lose the users' browsing paths.
