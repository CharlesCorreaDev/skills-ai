### IPs Not Allowed to Chat[​](#ips-not-allowed-to-chat "Direct link to IPs Not Allowed to Chat")

[More information](docs__docs__blocking.md#how-to-block-users-from-starting-a-chat)

### Enable Online Site Visitor Tracking[​](#enable-online-site-visitor-tracking "Direct link to Enable Online Site Visitor Tracking")

If you disable this option, online visitors will not be tracked. This will also disable the following features:

- Proactive invitations
- Online visitors list
- Previous chats detection

### Track online visitors even if there is no online operators[​](#track-online-visitors-even-if-there-is-no-online-operators "Direct link to Track online visitors even if there is no online operators")

It only effects old widget. If you are using new widget it can be ignored as it does nothing.

### Show need help tooltip?[​](#show-need-help-tooltip "Direct link to Show need help tooltip?")

This one tells should we show [need help](docs__docs__need-help.md) tooltip or not.

### Need help tooltip timeout, after how many hours show again tooltip?[​](#need-help-tooltip-timeout-after-how-many-hours-show-again-tooltip "Direct link to Need help tooltip timeout, after how many hours show again tooltip?")

Once visitor closes need help tooltip after how long we should show it again to him?

### Play sound on invitation to chat.[​](#play-sound-on-invitation-to-chat "Direct link to Play sound on invitation to chat.")

Should we play sound for a visitor when invitation it shown to him.

tip

New widget does not support this yet.

### Is pro active chat invitation active. Online users tracking also has to be enabled.[​](#is-pro-active-chat-invitation-active-online-users-tracking-also-has-to-be-enabled "Direct link to Is pro active chat invitation active. Online users tracking also has to be enabled.")

Enables/Disables proactive invitations in general.

### Should invitation logic be executed if there is no online operators[​](#should-invitation-logic-be-executed-if-there-is-no-online-operators "Direct link to Should invitation logic be executed if there is no online operators")

It effects only old widget. In a new widget invitations are shown only if there is online operators.

tip

This feature will be added to a new widget over time.

### Proactive message timeout in hours.[​](#proactive-message-timeout-in-hours "Direct link to Proactive message timeout in hours.")

After how many hours proactive chat mesasge should be shown again.

### Pro active chats invitations limitation based on pending chats.[​](#pro-active-chats-invitations-limitation-based-on-pending-chats "Direct link to Pro active chats invitations limitation based on pending chats.")

We will show invitation if only pending chats number satisfies required conditions.

(-1) do not limit, (0,1,n+1) number of pending chats can be for invitation to be shown.

### Track users footprint.[​](#track-users-footprint "Direct link to Track users footprint.")

For this also online visitors tracking should be enabled.

### Footprint updates should be processed in the background.[​](#footprint-updates-should-be-processed-in-the-background "Direct link to Footprint updates should be processed in the background.")

When chat starts we have to assign pageviews to a specific chat. As footprint table can get quite bit this operation takes time. So it makes sense just to delegate this task to background.

Make sure you are running [workflow cronjob](docs__docs__development__cronjob.md#default-cronjob-setup).

### Cleanup should be done only using cronjob.[​](#cleanup-should-be-done-only-using-cronjob "Direct link to Cleanup should be done only using cronjob.")

Time from time then new visitor comes we use this event to clean up online visitors tables. If record is older then defined `How many days keep records of online users.` setting. As this table can get quite big to avoid UI delay makes sense just to have this work happening in the background.

Make sure you are running [workflow cronjob](docs__docs__development__cronjob.md#default-cronjob-setup).

### How many days keep records of online users.[​](#how-many-days-keep-records-of-online-users "Direct link to How many days keep records of online users.")

Defines how long we should keep online users record from his last activity.

### How many days keep records of users footprint.[​](#how-many-days-keep-records-of-users-footprint "Direct link to How many days keep records of users footprint.")

Older records than defined amount will be deleted.

### How long department availability statistic should be kept? (days)[​](#how-long-department-availability-statistic-should-be-kept-days "Direct link to How long department availability statistic should be kept? (days)")

If you are using [department availability chart](docs__docs__chat__statistic.md#departments) you can define how long we should store this data.

Make sure you are running [workflow cronjob](docs__docs__development__cronjob.md#default-cronjob-setup).

### How long keep operators online sessions data? (days)[​](#how-long-keep-operators-online-sessions-data-days "Direct link to How long keep operators online sessions data? (days)")

This data is used to generate [agents performance statistic](docs__docs__chat__statistic.md#agents-statistic), but over time this table can get quite big so makes sense just have limited days this data should be stored.

Make sure you are running [workflow cronjob](docs__docs__development__cronjob.md#default-cronjob-setup).

## Misc[​](#misc "Direct link to Misc")

In this section can be found all the 😄 tricky settings. Most of the time you do not need to touch anything unless you want to play around.

### Set your domain to enable user tracking across different domain subdomains.[​](#set-your-domain-to-enable-user-tracking-across-different-domain-subdomains "Direct link to Set your domain to enable user tracking across different domain subdomains.")

This overrides javascript options and set's cookie always under defined domain. If you want more security and you will use chat only for one domain makes sense to enter this site domain. It has to be plain value like `example.com`

### Domains where script can be embedded. E.g example.com, google.com[​](#domains-where-script-can-be-embedded-eg-examplecom-googlecom "Direct link to Domains where script can be embedded. E.g example.com, google.com")

If you want to add more security and allow Live Helper Chat script to be embeded just on specific domain(s). You can set your domain here.
Domain's has to be separated by a comma. E.g

> livehelperchat.com, google.com

### Please enter explicit http mode. Either http: or https:, do not forget : at the end.[​](#please-enter-explicit-http-mode-either-http-or-https-do-not-forget--at-the-end "Direct link to Please enter explicit http mode. Either http: or https:, do not forget : at the end.")

If you want to be more explicit how data is going http or https you can set this to `https:` or `http:`. Usually there is no need to touch this parameter.

### Cookie should be valid only for domain where Javascript is embedded (excludes subdomains)[​](#cookie-should-be-valid-only-for-domain-where-javascript-is-embedded-excludes-subdomains "Direct link to Cookie should be valid only for domain where Javascript is embedded (excludes subdomains)")

Usually then you define domain in embed code 'example.com' cookie is valid also for subdomains. So chat can work within same domain and subdomains. If you want chat to be working only within exact domain you can check this option.

tip

New widget does not support this and if domain is defined it set's cookie for subdomains also. If you do not define domain in new widget it will work only within domain scope. So in general you can control how all works in a new widget based what you pass as domain.

- No domain - works only within domain
- You define domain - works also within subdomains.

### Use secure cookie, check this if you want to force SSL all the time[​](#use-secure-cookie-check-this-if-you-want-to-force-ssl-all-the-time "Direct link to Use secure cookie, check this if you want to force SSL all the time")

If you are using https connection all the time makes sense to check this as this will make chat cookie available only in secure `https://` mode.

### Preload widget. It will avoid loading delay after clicking widget[​](#preload-widget-it-will-avoid-loading-delay-after-clicking-widget "Direct link to Preload widget. It will avoid loading delay after clicking widget")

This option influences only old widget. Preloads widget content for old widget so it makes UI feel faster.
