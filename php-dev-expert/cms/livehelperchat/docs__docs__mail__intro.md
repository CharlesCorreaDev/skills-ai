See the [setup sample](docs__docs__mail__sample-mailbox.md).

- When a new email arrives, its status is set to "New."
- When an open reply ticket is created, the status becomes "Closed."
- If a new email arrives, the ticket is reopened. Whether a new ticket is created or an old one is reopened is determined by the "Timeout in days after last response before we create a new issue" setting in the mailbox "Options" section.
- In the dashboard, you can select which widgets to display. The new widgets include:
  - My active and new emails
  - Active emails
  - New emails
  - Mail queue alarm
