# Writing a theme

**Themes** are special types of plugins that change the look and feel of Matomo's UI. They use CSS and LESS to override the default styles defined by other Matomo plugins.

This guide will explain how to create a new theme. This guide assumes that you:

- can code in HTML, PHP, CSS and JavaScript,
- and have a general understanding of extending Matomo (if not, read our [Getting Started](develop__guides__getting-started-part-1.md) guide).

## Creating a new theme

To create an empty theme, run the following command from Matomo's root directory:

```
./console generate:theme
```

After you enter the appropriate information, a theme will be created for you in the `plugins/` directory. Now you need to activate this theme by going to "Administration => Plugins => Manage Themes" and activate your created theme.

## Simple theming

### Colors and fonts

Colors used in CSS are simple to override because they are defined as variables. These variables are defined in PHP because we also need to apply them to emails, PDF reports, exported images, etc.

For example to change the background from white to black you can simply change the following variable in your `$YourPluginName.php` file.

```
public function configureThemeVariables(Plugin\ThemeStyles $vars)
{
    $vars->colorBackgroundBase = '#000';
}
```

To change the link color to red you override the link variable:

```
public function configureThemeVariables(Plugin\ThemeStyles $vars)
{
    $vars->colorLink = '#f00';
}
```

To change the font you override the font variable:

```
public function configureThemeVariables(Plugin\ThemeStyles $vars)
{
    $vars->fontFamilyBase = 'Verdana, sans-serif';
}
```

You get the point. The list of all variables that you can override is defined in the Morpheus plugin:

- [ThemeStyles](https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/blob/6.x-dev/core/Plugin/ThemeStyles.php)

Although we do not recommend doing so, you can change the colors of a specific element directly, for example:

```
#login {
    background-color: red;
}
```

Please use this method only if needed. Element ids or classes might change in the future and break your theme.

### Icons override

Overriding icons is fairly easy: create a folder named `images` in your theme's directory and place an icon having the same file name as the icon you want to override.

For a complete list of icons you can override have a look at the [Morpheus theme](https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/tree/6.x-dev/plugins/Morpheus/images). It is not yet possible to override icons used in reports such as browser or search engine icons, but if you have suggestions, you can [open an issue in the piwik-icon repository](https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo-icons).

### Logo and favicon

As Matomo users can upload their own logo and favicon using the admin interface a theme is not supposed to change any of those.

## Advanced theming

### Adding styles

Every theme has one main file that contains all of your theme's styling overrides. The location of this file is determined by the **stylesheet** property in your theme's `plugin.json` file. The property's value is a path relative to the plugin's root directory:

```
{
    "name": "MyTheme",
    "description": "A new theme.",
    "theme": true,
    "stylesheet": "stylesheets/theme.less"
}
```

Generated themes will already have a file configured, so you don't need to set this property. The file is called `theme.less` and is located in the `stylesheets/` directory of your theme.

You can put your entire theme into this one file if you want, but the result might not be easy to read and to maintain. Instead, you should group the styles based on the part of Matomo (formerly Piwik) they modify and place them in separate LESS files. You can then [`@import`](https://lesscss.org/features/#import-directives-feature) them in `theme.less`.

### Adding JavaScript files

Themes can also add new JavaScript files. These files can be used to style things that can't be styled through CSS or LESS.

To add JavaScript files, add them as an array to the **javascript** property in your theme's `plugin.json` file:

```
{
    "name": "MyTheme",
    "description": "A new theme.",
    "theme": true,
    "stylesheet": "stylesheets/theme.less",
    "javascript": ["javascripts/myJavaScriptFile.js", "javascripts/myOtherJavaScriptFile.js"]
}
```

### Theming colors used in JavaScript & PHP

Some colors are only used in JavaScript and in PHP. We've made it possible for those colors to be specified through CSS, but the process is a bit different from setting colors of normal HTML elements.

Each color used in JavaScript is given a name and grouped in a *color namespace*. You can set these colors like this:

```
.color-namespace-name[data-name=color-name] {
    color: red;
}
```

For example,

```
.bar-graph-colors[data-name=grid-background] {
    color: @background-color-base;
}

.bar-graph-colors[data-name=grid-border] {
    color: @basic-grid-border-color;
}
```

## Twig, the template engine

Matomo uses the [Twig templating engine](https://twig.symfony.com) to create HTML pages from PHP.

When creating a theme, you do not need to create or change any template as the recommended way is to only use Less (CSS) and JavaScript. However, in some rare cases where advanced customisation is necessary, you may need to customise Twig templates.

Please note that this is not recommended, so use at your own risk.

To override a twig templates from the default `Morpheus` theme, place a `.twig` template file with the same name in your `templates/` directory as follows:

```
plugins/[MyThemePlugin]/templates/dashboard.twig
```

To override twig templates used in a plugin, place a `.twig` template file with the same name in your plugin's `templates/` directory as follows:

```
plugins/[MyThemePlugin]/templates/plugins/[OverriddenPlugin]/[overriddenTemplate].twig
```
