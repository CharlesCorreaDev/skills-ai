The `settings` property in `theme.json` lets you configure a wide range of settings for a WordPress install. It covers everything from color presets, to enabling typography design tools, to layout, and a little bit of everything in between.

This document contains links for learning about each of these settings, which have their own individual documentation pages.

## [The settings property](#the-settings-property)

`settings` is a top-level property in `theme.json` and has multiple nested properties that you can define. And some of those nested properties have multiple levels of nesting of their own.

The following is an overarching look at these properties in the context of a `theme.json` file:

```
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"appearanceTools": false,
		"border": {},
		"color": {},
		"custom": {},
		"dimensions": {},
		"layout": {},
		"position": {},
		"shadow": {},
		"spacing": {},
		"typography": {},
		"useRootPaddingAwareAlignments": false,
		"blocks": {}
	}
}
```
