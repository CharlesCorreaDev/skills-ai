## [Add a File block](#add-a-file-block)

1. To add a File block**,** use the **Block Inserter** (+), or you can type `/file` in a new paragraph block and press enter.

2. To add a file, you can use the upload button to upload your files directly from your computer, or you can click **Media Library** to add files from your media library.

![How to upload a file ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-21-at-11.40.04-AM-1024x424.png)

3. Content-Only Editing Support

The **File block** supports **content-only editing**, allowing editors to update the block’s inner content—such as the file name and download button text—without modifying its structure or settings.

[](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/file-content-editing.mp4)

Key Features:

- Available when using **Write mode** in the Site Editor.
- Enables quick updates to file content in locked templates or sections.
- Matches behavior of other media blocks like the Image block.

### [User roles and capabilities](#user-roles-and-capabilities)

Some elements of the File block are only available to certain user roles. By default, only Administrators, Editors and Authors can upload a file using the file block. [Learn more about WordPress user roles and capabilities.](article__roles-and-capabilities.md)

## [Block toolbar](#block-toolbar)

Every block comes with unique toolbar icons and block-specific user controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

The File block has seven buttons:

- Transform to
- Drag icon
- Move handles
- Change alignment
- Replace
- Copy URL
- More options
