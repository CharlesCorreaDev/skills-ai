**Code** block lets you add and display code snippets for others to view.

**Code** block example:

    action1();
    action2();

    action3();
    action4();

}
```

## [Add a Code block](#add-a-code-block)

To add the **Code** block, open the block inserter by clicking the (**+**) icon on the upper left corner of the editor. After that, look for **Code** using the search bar and click it to insert the block into the editor.

### [Transform to](#transform-to)

The Transform to button lets you change the **Code** block into a *Paragraph*, *Columns*, *Group*, *Custom HTML* or *Preformatted blocks*.

Transforming the **Code** block into *Group* will give you the ability to change the background color around the code.

### [Moving handles](#moving-handles)

The dotted icons can be used to drag and drop a block to the place of your choosing. The up and down arrow icons can be used to shift a block up and down in your document.

The *change alignment* tool lets you align the **Code**block within the content. You can choose one of the following alignment options:

You can select the text in the **Code** block and use the *Bold* option or **Ctrl+B** / **Cmd+B** on your keyboard to bold it, which is usually heavier than the surrounding text.
