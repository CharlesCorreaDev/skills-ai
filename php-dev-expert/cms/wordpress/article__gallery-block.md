The Gallery block allows you to easily add multiple photos and automatically arrange them in a gallery. You can control the number of columns and the size of the images in the gallery.

## [Add a Gallery block](#add-a-gallery-block)

Add the Gallery block to a page by clicking on the **Block Inserter +** icon and selecting the Gallery block.

Adding the Gallery block

Alternatively, you can type `/gallery` and press Enter.

### [Use attached images](#use-attached-images)

Select the **Use attached images** button after adding a gallery block to create a dynamic gallery that will automatically add images that are attached to your post. If you add a new image, the gallery will automatically update.

![Gallery initial state with Upload, Media Library and Use Attached images options.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/Screenshot-2026-09-18-at-2.42.27-PM-1024x369.png)

If you wish to convert the dynamic gallery to a regular gallery, you can use the Detach button from the block toolbar or the Detach Gallery button in the block settings sidebar.

## [Block toolbar](#block-toolbar)

Each block has its own block-specific controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

### [For the entire block](#for-the-entire-block)

The Gallery block has a toolbar for the individual images as well as a toolbar for the entire Gallery block.

#### [Transform to](#transform-to)

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/gallery-block-transform-options.png)

**Transform to** menu showing the blocks the Gallery block can convert to.

The buttons in **Transform to** let you change the block to an Image, Columns, Group, Details, or Grid block.

Choosing Image converts each gallery image into its own Image block. Choosing Grid places those Image blocks inside a Grid block.

#### [Block moving handles](#block-moving-handles)

![Moving a gallery block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-20-at-10.16.08-AM.png)

The block-moving handles allow you to move the block up and down the editor. Use the grab handle (six dots button) to drag and drop the Gallery block and place it anywhere on the page. Alternatively, click on the up and down arrows to move the block up or down by one step.

#### [Change alignment](#change-alignment)

![Gallery block alignment and width](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-20-at-10.16.28-AM.png)

- **Align left** – Align the block to the left

- **Align right** – Align the block to the right
- **Wide width** – Increase the width of the block beyond the content size
- **Full width** – Extend the block to cover the full width of the screen

**Wide width** and **Full width** alignment options are only available if they are enabled in your theme.

#### [Link](#link)

You can choose link options to apply to all images in your gallery.

![Gallery link options.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/Screenshot-2026-03-06-at-3.05.21-PM-1024x408.jpg)

- **Link images to attachment pages** – Selecting this option will link the image to its WordPress media [attachment](article__inserting-images-into-posts-and-pages.md#step-4-attachment-details) page.
  - This is an informational page about your image, which includes the image, the caption, the image description, and a comment field.
- **Link images to media files** – Selecting this option will link the image to the image file in the original size in a new browser window.
- **Enlarge on click** – Selecting this option lets visitors open gallery images in a larger view, also known as a lightbox, without leaving the page. Visitors will be able to move forward and backward through each image in the lightbox.
- **None**: Selecting this option will not link the image to anything.

#### [Caption for the gallery](#caption-for-the-gallery)

You can add a caption to the whole gallery by clicking on the **Caption** icon on the block settings toolbar.

![Adding a caption to the gallery block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/gallery-caption-1024x641.png)

Adding a caption to the Gallery block

You can add captions for individual images using the caption button in each image block’s toolbar.

![Caption text on top of an individual image in the Gallery block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/gallery-block-individual-image-caption.png)

#### [Adding images](#adding-images)

The **Add** button in the Gallery block lets you add images to the gallery. You have two ways of doing this: **Open Media Library** and **Upload**.

![Adding images to the gallery block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-20-at-10.16.45-AM.png)

Adding images to the Gallery block

The Upload option allows you to upload a new image or multiple images to the Gallery block. It will add them to your Media Library at the same time. The Media Library option lets you choose from images you uploaded to your Media Library earlier.

You can also drag and drop multiple images at the same time from your explorer or finder window into the Gallery block.

Alternatively, you can open the main inserter panel on the editor and open the media tab. Then, you can drag and drop images from the media library and Openverse into the Gallery block.

#### [More options](#more-options)

These controls give you the option to copy, duplicate, and edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](article__more-options.md)

### [For an individual image](#for-an-individual-image)

Each image inside a Gallery block is an Image block. When you select an individual image, the toolbar shows Image block controls for that image, such as link, crop, replace, and more. These settings affect only the selected image, not the entire Gallery block.

![Individual image block toolbar with the 'Select parent block: Gallery' button in focus](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/gallery-block-toolbar-select-gallery-button-1024x219.png)

If you want to return to the full Gallery block settings, use the **Select parent block: Gallery** button in the toolbar. This lets you edit gallery-wide settings, such as columns, image resolution, cropping, and layout.

**Note**: Some options such as **Add text over image** or **Align** may not be present or may not work as expected when an Image block is inside a Gallery block.

#### [Move images](#move-images)

Once you have added images to your Gallery block, you can change the order of the images in the gallery. Click on an image, and in the block toolbar use the **move left** and **move right** arrow handles or the grab handle (six dots button) to arrange the images as you like.

## [Block settings](#block-settings)

As well as the options in the block toolbar, every block has specific options in the editor sidebar. If you don’t see the sidebar, click on the **Settings** button next to the **Save/Publish** button.

![Settings button highlighted in the block editor next to the Save button.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/block-settings-7-0.png)

The Gallery block settings panel is divided into three tabs – **List View**, **Settings**, and **Styles**.

### [List View tab](#list-view-tab)

The **List View** tab allows you to drag and drop images within the gallery to reorder them. When hovering over an image in List View, click on the More options (three dots) button for additional block controls like copy, duplicate, hide, delete, and more.

[Learn about the More options menu](article__more-options.md).

### [Settings tab](#settings-tab)

The Gallery block includes the following settings:

![Gallery block settings including column slider, resolution dropdown, and image controls.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2026/09/gallery-block-settings-e1779421075171-edited.png)

#### [Columns](#columns)

Use the Columns setting to choose how many columns appear in the gallery.

You can choose 1 to 8 columns, but only up to the number of images in the gallery. For example, a gallery with 4 images can have up to 4 columns. Add more images to use more columns, up to the maximum of 8.

To change the number of columns, either:

- Enter a number in the field
- Use the slider to increase or decrease the number of columns

#### [Resolution](#resolution)

You can also choose the **Resolution** of your image with options that may include **Full Size**, **Large**, **Medium** and **Thumbnail** depending on what your theme supports and the size of the originally uploaded image.

[Learn more about image size and quality.](article__image-size-and-quality.md)

#### [Crop images to fit](#crop-images-to-fit)

You can select whether or not you’d like all of your images to be cropped in your Gallery block.

This option is useful if you have images of varying sizes and shapes. Cropping them will make the images in each row of the gallery the same size. Toggle this option on and off to see which way you’d prefer.

#### [Open images in a new tab](#open-images-in-a-new-tab)

If any [Link options](article__gallery-block.md#link) are enabled for the gallery, you can choose whether you want images to open in a new browser tab window when the visitor clicks on them.

#### [Randomize order](#randomize-order)

This button will juggle the order of images in the Gallery block.

**Note**: in the block editor, the images will still appear in the order they were added. But on the published post, they will be displayed in a random order.

#### [Aspect ratio](#aspect-ratio)

This setting changes the aspect ratio of all of the images in the Gallery to one consistent ratio.

[](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/gallery-block-aspect-ratio.mp4)

#### [Navigation button type](#navigation-button-type)

If **Enlarge on click** is enabled in [Link options](#link) for the Gallery, you can choose the style of the lightbox’s previous, next, and close navigation buttons.

- **Icon**: only icons display
- **Text**: only text labels display
- **Both**: both icons and text labels display
