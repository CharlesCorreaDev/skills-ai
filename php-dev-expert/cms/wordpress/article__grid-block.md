Grid block is one of the container blocks that can be used to organize multiple blocks and adjust the height, width, and position of all blocks inside the container. As a container block, it’s possible to transform a Grid block into a Group, Row or Stack block without changing the content of the block.

## [Add a Grid block](#add-a-grid-block)

To add a Grid block, click the **+ Block Inserter** button in the top-left corner of the editor. Search for the Grid block and click on the block to add it to the page

[Get detailed instructions on adding blocks](article__adding-a-new-block.md).

## [Block toolbar](#block-toolbar)

To view the block toolbar, click on the block, and the toolbar will be displayed.

Every block comes with unique toolbar icons. These block-specific controls allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

### [Block-moving tools](#block-moving-tools)

Use the block-moving tools to move the Grid block.

The **drag** or **six dots** icon allows you to freely reposition the block anywhere within the editor by holding the icon and dragging it to the new location.

You can also use the **arrow icons** to move the block up or down within the group of nested blocks or when there are multiple blocks.

- **None** – Keep width the same as the content size
- **Wide width** – Increase the width of the block beyond the content size
- **Full width** – Extend the block to cover the full width of the screen

**Wide width** and **Full width** alignment options are only available if they are enabled in your theme.

### [Background](#background)

The Background settings allow you to customize the appearance of supported blocks using background images, colors, and gradients.

For details, refer to the [Background Settings Overview](article__background-settings-overview.md).

### [Layout](#layout)

![Grid layout](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/09/Screenshot-2026-09-05-at-11.09.04-AM.png)

In the Grid block’s **Layout** settings, you can control how many columns appear in each row.

- **Max. columns** – Sets the maximum number of columns the grid can show in one row.
- **Min. column width** – Sets the smallest width each column can be before the grid wraps to fewer columns per row.

Use a combination of these settings to control how the grid scales across various screen sizes.

For example, if you set **Max. columns** to `4` and **Min. column width** to `12rem`, the grid displays up to 4 columns when space permits. On narrower screens, the grid automatically wraps content into 3, 2, or 1 column to fit the screen width.

#### [Fill available space](#fill-available-space)

Enable the toggle to Fill available space by clicking on the three dot menu at the top right of the **Layout** settings panel. When this is selected, content inside the grid columns will automatically stretch to fill the available space, instead of leaving gaps when there are too few items to fill a row.
