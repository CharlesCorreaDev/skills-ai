The Site editor allows you to design the entire site including the header, footer, and everything in between, with [blocks](article__blocks.md). It gives you greater control over how your site looks.

The Site Editor is **only** available when you install and activate a [Block theme](article__block-themes.md) on your site.

## [How to access the Site editor](#how-to-access-this-feature)

To work with the Site editor, you need to use a[block theme](article__block-themes.md) on your site. A block theme is a theme that uses [blocks](article__blocks.md) for all parts of a site, including navigation menus, header, content, and site footer.

All [blocks](article__blocks.md) that are available in the [WordPress Block editor](article__wordpress-editor.md) can be used in the Site editor. A set of blocks called [Theme blocks](article__blocks.md#theme-blocks) are specifically built for the Site editor.

To find block themes, from the WordPress dashboard, go to **Appearance** > **Themes** and click **Add New**. In the **Add Themes** page, select **Block Themes** to find the growing list of [Block themes](article__block-themes.md) in the [WordPress theme directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/).

![Appearance > Themes showing block theme options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/01/Appearance-Themes-showing-block-themes-1024x517.png)

How to find a block theme

Once you install and activate a Block theme on your site, go to **Appearance** > **Editor** to open the Site Editor.

![Appearance section of the admin interface showing the Themes and Editor entry points after activating a block theme. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2023-03-27-at-6.23.05-PM.png)

## [Things to do in the Site Editor](#how-to-access-this-feature-2)

The top menu in the Site editor includes the following options:

    - You can choose to save all or just some of them.
    - Note that some changes (like changes to the Header and Footer templates) will apply to all pages of your site that use those templates, and not just the page you were working on.

![Site editor with an arrow pointing to the three dot menu where extra settings can be found. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/Site-Editor-More-options-432x1024.png)

12. **Admin bar**: WordPress 7.1 brings a persistent Admin bar into every Site Editor screen. It provides consistent access to WordPress and site navigation while you work in the editor. If a Site Icon is set, it is displayed in the Toolbar. The Toolbar is hidden when Distraction Free mode is enabled.

**View top toolbar**: Display or hide the top toolbar in the editor. When you enable this option, block toolbars are pinned to the top of the WordPress block editor (right under the top toolbar) instead of appearing directly above the block.

## [How to use the Site Editor](#how-to-use-the-site-editor-2)

### [To edit the site’s styles](#to-edit-the-sites-styles)

### [To customize the site’s layout](#to-customize-the-sites-layout)

You can use the Site Editor to build the structure and layout of your entire site, using blocks. Eg: areas like headers, footers, and the structural appearance of your site’s posts and pages.

All [blocks](article__blocks.md) that are available in the [WordPress Block Editor](article__wordpress-editor.md) can be used in the Site Editor. A set of blocks called [Theme blocks](article__blocks.md#theme-blocks) are specifically built for the Site Editor.

Examples: the [Query Loop Block](article__query-loop-block.md) allows you to customize the look and feel of your post layout, the [Navigation Block](article__navigation-block.md) lets you customize the site’s navigation menu, the [Site Title Block](article__site-title-block.md) helps to customize the Site Title and more.

Check out the full list of [Theme blocks](article__blocks.md#theme-blocks).

#### [Example – How to Customize Twenty Twenty-Three using the Site Editor](#example-how-to-customize-twenty-twenty-three-using-the-site-editor)

### [To manage the site’s templates](#to-manage-the-sites-templates)

WordPress uses [templates](article__template-editor.md) to create the layout and structure for specific page types on your site. The Site Editor displays the template choices that you can add to your site and lets you create custom templates using the [Template Editor](article__template-editor.md).

### [To manage the template parts](#to-manage-the-template-parts)

A Template part is a block for managing the repeating global areas of the site such as a Header, Footer, Sidebar, etc. They are primarily meant to define the site structure and can be reused. You can also create custom Template Parts that can be reused through the templates.

From the **Appearance** > **Editor**, click the **Patterns** option. From All templates parts, you can access to them.

## [Useful tools when using the Site Editor](#useful-tools-when-using-the-site-editor)

The following tools are helpful when using the Site Editor.

### [The Command Palette](#the-command-palette)

The Command Palette offers you a quick way to navigate the **content** of your site and to invoke different **actions** such as creating new posts/pages, toggling preferences, and accessing your styles and custom CSS settings.

You can open the Command Palette from the WordPress Admin bar while working in the Site Editor. In Site View, you can also access it from the search control in the Site Editor navigation. You can open it from the keyboard with `Cmd+K` on macOS or `Ctrl+K` on Windows and Linux.

Learn more about the Command Palette in this support article: [Site Editor Command Palette](https://wordpress.org/support/article/site-editor-command-palette).

### [List View](#list-view)

List View helps you navigate complex block layouts and nested block structures. You can select exactly which block you need, and get a quick overview of the block layout on the page you are working on. You can easily select multiple blocks and edit, move or group them.

[](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/site-editor-list-view.mp4)

Learn more about List View in this support article:  [List View](article__list-view.md).

### [Block Patterns](#block-patterns)

Block Patterns are a collection of predefined blocks that you can insert into posts and pages. You can then customize them further. WordPress comes with a set of standard Block Patterns. You can also find Block Patterns bundled with the [block themes](article__block-themes.md).

Learn more about Block Patterns in this support article: [Block Pattern](article__block-pattern.md).

### [Copy and paste styles](#copy-and-paste-styles)

With WordPress 6.2, a new option was added to allow you to copy and paste block styles, making it easy to reuse designs you’ve created. You can find this from the three dot menu in any block and it’s meant to be used to copy and paste between the same type of block:

[](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/site-editor-copy-paste-styles.mp4)

### [Apply style changes globally](#apply-style-changes-globally)

If you’re more comfortable with more advanced options when creating a design or customizing individual blocks, as of WordPress 6.2, you can take changes made to an individual block and apply it to **all blocks of the same type**. For example, you could apply a single design for an individual block to all blocks in your site with a new option under the **Advanced** section of block settings.

![How to apply the current's block style to all styles of that same type across your site by clicking on Block Settings > Advanced > Apply Globally](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/site-editor-apply-styles-globally-1024x593.png)

### [Resize the preview of the Site Editor](#resize-the-preview-of-the-site-editor)

When you’re in the Site Editor, you might want to change the preview of the template or template part you’re viewing. You can do this by selecting the handles of the dark gray sidebar and moving it to your liking.

[](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/site-editor-resize-pattern-preview.mov)

### [Zoom out mode](#zoom-out-mode)

![Zoom out toggle](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/01/zoom-out-toggle.png)

Zoom Out View provides a condensed visual overview of the entire page structure, enabling users to quickly assess the hierarchy, placement, and design of individual sections without having to scroll through each block in detail.
