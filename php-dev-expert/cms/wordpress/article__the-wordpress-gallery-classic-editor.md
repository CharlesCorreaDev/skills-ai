This article introduces how to add an image gallery using the media library, and explains gallery shortcode which will be generated and embedded into the post or page.

## [Adding image gallery using media library](#adding-image-gallery-using-media-library)

Here’s how to add an image gallery step-by-step, using the media uploader:

*Note: Before adding a gallery, you should be comfortable using the* Add media *feature and the media uploader to [add images to your media library and place them into posts](https://wordpress.org/support/article/inserting-images-into-posts-and-pages/).*

### [Step 1 – Place your cursor](#step-1-place-your-cursor)

A gallery can go anywhere on a page or post – by itself on a blank page, or above, below, or in the midst of text. Start by placing your cursor where you want the gallery to appear – if it’s in between blocks of text, like in the photo example below, consider adding a return and placing your cursor on a new line so there’s space above and below.

[![Placing cursor where gallery should be](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/gallery-place-cursor.png?fit=580%2C261&ssl=1)](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/gallery-place-cursor.png?fit=580%2C261&ssl=1)

Place cursor where gallery should be

### [Step 2 – Click the Add Media button](#step-2-click-the-add-media-button)

Once you’ve placed your cursor where you want your image gallery to appear, click on the Add Media button (located left above the editing window) to launch the media uploader interface. In the resulting popup window, select the ‘Create a Gallery’ option from the list of actions on the left.

[![Clicking the add media button above editor](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/gallery-add-media-button.png?fit=423%2C232&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/gallery-add-media-button.png?fit=423%2C232&ssl=1)

Click “Add Media” button

### [Step 3 – Add and/or Select the Images You Want to Include](#step-3-add-and-or-select-the-images-you-want-to-include)

You can add or select the images you want to include in your image gallery by choosing from either of the following options in the center of the media uploader window:

- **Upload Files:** Upload the images you want to use from your computer by dragging them into the upload area. You can add more than one image, and they will be automatically grouped together as an image gallery.
- **Media Library:** Select from previously uploaded images in the media library by clicking on the ones you wish to add to the gallery. You will see a checkbox next to your selections.

[![Drag and drop files into media library to create gallery](https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/drag-to-start-gallery.png?fit=628%2C415&ssl=1)](https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/drag-to-start-gallery.png?fit=628%2C415&ssl=1)

Drag and drop multiple files to Media Library

*Note: You can create an image gallery using any combination of new images and previously uploaded images simply by switching back and forth between the Upload Files and Media Library tabs.*

As you upload and/or select images, you will see your selection confirmed on the Insert Media screen by check boxes at the top corner of each thumbnail. Also, a row of thumbnails appears at the bottom of the window to help you keep track of all the images you’ve selected. When you are happy with your selection, click the **Create a new gallery** button.

## [Gallery shortcode](#gallery-shortcode)

Above steps generates Gallery shortcode with image ids and other options, and embedded into the Post or Page, like this:

```
[gallery ids="729,732,731,720"]
```

You can specify options direct to this shortcode.

### [Usage](#usage)

There are several options that may be specified using this syntax:

```

```

### [Options](#options)

The following basic options are supported:

**orderby**

Specifies how to sort the displayed thumbnails. The default is “menu\_order.”

Options:

- **menu\_order** – You can reorder the images in the Gallery tab of the Add Media pop-up.
- **title** – Order images in the Media Library, based on the image title.
- **post\_date** – Sort images by date/time.
- **rand** – Order images randomly.
- **ID**

**order**

```

**columns**

Specifies the number of columns. The gallery will include a break tag at the end of each row, and calculate the column width as appropriate. The default value is 3. If columns is set to 0, no row breaks will be included. For example, to display a 4 column gallery:

```
[gallery columns="4"]
```

**id**

Specifies the post ID. The gallery will display images which are attached to that post. The default behavior, if no ID is specified, is to display images attached to the current post. For example, to display images attached to post 123:

```

The default value is “thumbnail.” The size of the images for “thumbnail,” “medium,” and “large” can be configured in the WordPress admin panel under Settings > Media.
