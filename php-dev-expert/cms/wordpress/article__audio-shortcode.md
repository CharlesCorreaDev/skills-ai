The Audio feature allows you to embed audio files and play them back using a simple Shortcode. This was added as of WordPress 3.6 and is used like this:

```
[ audio]
```

Note: Do not put space between “[” and “audio”.

You can also use build-in embeds and simply put the media file on its own line:

```
My cool content  
http://my.mp3s.com/cool/songs/coolest.mp3  
More cool content
```

## [Usage](#usage)

I have an old post that has an audio file in the Media Library attached to it, and I want to use the new shortcode:

```
[ audio]
```

Note: Do Not put Space between “[” and “audio”.

I have the URL for an MP3, from the Media Library or external, that I want to play:

```
[audio src="audio-source.mp3"]
```

I have a source URL and fallbacks for other HTML5-supported filetypes:

```
[audio mp3="source.mp3" ogg="source.ogg" wav="source.wav"]
```

## [Options](#options)

The following basic options are supported:

`src`  
([string](article__glossary.md#string)) (optional) The source of your audio file. If not included it will auto-populate with the first audio file attached to the post. You can use the following options to define specific filetypes, allowing for graceful fallbacks:

- ‘mp3’, ‘m4a’, ‘ogg’, ‘wav’, ‘wma’

Default: First audio file attached to the post

`loop`  
([string](article__glossary.md#string)) (optional) Allows for the looping of media.

- “off” – Do not loop the media.
- “on” – Media will loop to the beginning when finished and automatically continue playing.

Default: “off”

`autoplay`  
([string](article__glossary.md#string)) (optional) Causes the media to automatically play as soon as the media file is ready.

- “off” – Do not automatically play the media.
- “on” – Media will play as soon as it is ready.

Default: “off”

`preload`  
([string](article__glossary.md#string)) (optional) Specifies if and how the audio should be loaded when the page loads. Defaults to “none”

- “none” – The audio should not be loaded when the page loads.
- “auto” – The audio should be loaded entirely when the page loads.
- “metadata” – Only metadata should be loaded when the page loads.

Default: “none”
