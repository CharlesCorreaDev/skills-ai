With the *Crowdsignal Embed* block, you can embed Crowdsignal polls (or surveys or votes) into your posts and pages. You need a Crowdsignal account to be able to create polls (or surveys or votes) before you can embed them into your posts or pages.

Since WordPress 4.2, it has supported surveys created with the block editor powered survey/project editor, which are published on `*.crowdsignal.net`.

## [Steps to embed Crowdsignal polls (or surveys or votes):](#steps-to-embed-crowdsignal-polls-or-surveys-or-votes)

1. **Go to crowdsignal.com and signup for a free account.**   
   On your Crowdsignal Dashboard, create a new survey, poll, quiz, or rating, or select one you’ve already created.

If you use a URL that can’t be embedded, the block shows the message *“Sorry, this content could not be embedded.”* You will have two choices: Try again with a different URL or convert to link.

## [Block Toolbar](#block-toolbar)

Besides the Mover and Drag & Drop Handle, the Block Toolbar for the Crowdsignal embed shows four buttons:

- Transform to
- Change alignment
- Edit URL, and
- More options.

**Transform to**:

![Options to transform the Crowdsignal block to Paragraph, Columns or Group.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Crowdsignal-HelpHub-SS-11-1.png)

You can transform a Crowdsignal embed into a Paragraph, Columns, or Group. Transforming it into a Group would give you the ability to change the background color around the Crowdsignal embed.

![Alignment options for the Crowdsignal block: wide width, full width, align left, align center, and align right.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Crowdsignal-HelpHub-SS-14-1.png)

- Wide width – Increase the width of the post beyond the content size
- Full width – extend the Crowdsignal post to cover the full width of the screen.
- Align left – Make the Crowdsignal post left aligned
- Align center – Make the Crowdsignal post alignment centered
- Align right – Make the Crowdsignal post align right

*“Wide width” and “Full width” alignment need to be enabled by the Theme of your site.*

**Edit URL**:

Via the edit URL, you can change the Crowdsignal Embed URL in the embed block. Overwrite the existing URL and click on the “Embed” Button.

![Editing the Crowdsignal block URL via the "edit" option.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Crowdsignal-HelpHub-SS-15-1.png)

**More options**

The More Options menu represented by three vertical dots on the far right of the toolbar gives you more features such as the ability to duplicate, remove, or edit your block as HTML.

## [Block Settings](#block-settings)

Besides the Advanced section, the Crowdsignal embed has only one other setting in the “Block Settings” sidebar: Media Settings.

### [Media Settings](#media-settings)

![Media settings for the Crowdsignal embed block with the toggle OFF for resizing on smaller devices.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Crowdsignal-HelpHub-SS-20.png)

![Media settings for the Crowdsignal embed block with the toggle ON for resizing on smaller devices.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Crowdsignal-HelpHub-SS-19.png)

Via the *Media Settings* you can control the behavior of your embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is “on” or blue.

**“Off:”** This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the off position, the toggle switch is gray.

**“On:”** This embed will preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. The toggle switch turns blue in the “On” position.

**Advanced**

The following Advanced settings options are available: HTML Anchor, Additional CSS Class(es), Additional CSS, and Styles.
