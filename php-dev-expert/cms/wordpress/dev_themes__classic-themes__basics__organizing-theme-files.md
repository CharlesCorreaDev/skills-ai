While WordPress themes technically only require two files (`index.php` in classic themes and `index.html` in block themes, and `style.css`), they usually are made up of many files. That means they can quickly become disorganized! This section will show you how to keep your files organized.

## [Theme folder and file structure](#theme-folder-and-file-structure)

As mentioned previously, the default Twenty themes are some of the best examples of good theme development. For instance, here is how the [Twenty Seventeen Theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyseventeen/) organizes its [file structure](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen):

```
.
├── assets (dir)/
│   ├── css (dir)
│   ├── images (dir)
│   └── js (dir)
├── inc (dir)
├── template-parts (dir)/
│   ├── footer (dir)
│   ├── header (dir)
│   ├── navigation (dir)
│   ├── page (dir)
│   └── post (dir)
├── 404.php
├── archive.php
├── comments.php
├── footer.php
├── front-page.php
├── functions.php
├── header.php
├── index.php
├── page.php
├── README.txt
├── rtl.css
├── screenshot.png
├── search.php
├── searchform.php
├── sidebar.php
├── single.php
└── style.css
```

You can see that the main theme template files are in the root directory, while JavaScript, CSS, images are placed in assets directory, template-parts are placed in under respective subdirectory of template-parts and collection of  functions related to core functionalities are placed in inc directory.

There are no required folders in classic themes. In block themes, templates must be placed inside a folder called **templates**, and all template parts must be placed inside a folder called **parts**.

`style.css` should reside in the root directory of your theme not within the CSS directory.

### [Languages folder](#languages-folder)

It’s best practice to [internationalize your theme](dev_themes__functionality__internationalization.md "Internationalization") so it can be translated into other languages. Default themes include the `languages` folder, which contains a .pot file for translation and any translated .mo files. While `languages` is the default name of this folder, you can change the name. If you do so, you must update `load_theme_textdomain()`.
