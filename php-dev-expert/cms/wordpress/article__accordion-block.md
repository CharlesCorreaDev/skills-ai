[Go to the list of Blocks](https://wordpress.org/support/article/blocks/)

The Accordion block lets you show content in collapsible sections so visitors can expand just the parts they need. It’s commonly used for FAQs, schedules, or any long page you want to make easier to scan. Each Accordion contains Accordion Item blocks. Every item has:

- Accordion Heading: the clickable title.
- Accordion Panel: the content that expands and collapses. You can add any blocks in the panel.

## [Add an Accordion block](#add-an-accordion-block)

To add the Accordionblock, click the **+ Block Inserter** button in the top-left corner of the editor. Search for the Accordion block and click on the block to add it to the page.

Alternatively, you can quickly add the Accordionblock by typing `/accordion` and pressing **Enter**.

## [Add, edit, and reorder Accordion Items](#add-edit-and-reorder-accordion-items)

- Add a new item: Click the **+ Add item** button inside the block (or use the inserter at the end of the list).
- Edit a heading: Click the Accordion Heading and type a short, descriptive title.
- Add content: Click inside the Accordion Panel and add any blocks you need (paragraphs, images, lists, etc.).
- Reorder items: Use the move handles in the toolbar or drag items in List View to change the order.
- Expand/collapse while editing: Click a heading to toggle the panel open or closed so you can focus on one item at a time.

## [Accordion inner blocks](#accordion-inner-blocks)

The Accordion block is made of a few blocks to pull the feature together:

- Accordion item
- Accordion panel

These inner blocks may include additional style controls depending on your theme (colors, typography, spacing). For the Accordion item, you can pick the semantic heading level for the item’s title (for example, H3, H4). Use levels that fit your page outline.

## [Tips](#tips)

- Keep headings short and descriptive so visitors know what each item contains.
- Use consistent heading levels across items (for example, all H3s) that fit your page’s heading structure.
- For long content, consider splitting items into smaller sections or using lists inside the panel.
- Save frequently used accordions (like an FAQ) as a Pattern so you can reuse them across your site.

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

- The Accordion block follows accessible patterns so headings act as buttons and panels announce their expanded/collapsed state to assistive technologies.
- Best practices:
  - Use meaningful, concise headings.
  - Avoid placing interactive elements (like links or buttons) inside the heading itself; put them in the panel.
  - Choose heading levels that follow your page hierarchy.

## [Frequently asked questions](#frequently-asked-questions)
