## [Audio](#audio)

You can directly embed audio files and play them back using a simple shortcode **[audio]**. Supported file types are mp3, ogg, wma, m4a and wav.

### [Audio shortcode](#audio-shortcode)

Following shortcode displays audio player that loads music.mp3 file:

```
[[audio src="music.mp3"]]
```

To use the shortcode from template file, use do\_shortcode function. When music.mp3 file was stored in (theme\_directory)/sounds directory, insert following code into your template file:

```
$music_file = get_template_directory_uri() . "/sounds/music.mp3";
echo do_shortcode('[[audio mp3=' . $music_file . ']]');
```

The shortcode creates the audio player as shown in the screenshot below.

### [Loop and Autoplay](#loop-and-autoplay)

The following basic options are supported:

#### [loop](#loop)

Allows for the looping of media.

- “off” – Do not loop the media. Default.
- “on” – Media will loop to beginning when finished and automatically continue playing.

#### [autoplay](#autoplay)

Causes the media to automatically play as soon as the media file is ready.

- 0 – Do not automatically play the media. Default.
- 1 – Media will play as soon as it is ready.

The following example starts playing music immediately after the page load and loops.

```
echo do_shortcode('[[audio mp3=' . $music_file . ' loop = "on" autoplay = 1]]');
```

### [Styling](#styling)

If you want to change the look & feel of audio player, you can do so by targeting the default class name of “wp-audio-shortcode”. If you insert following code into your style.css, half width of audio player will be displayed.

```
.wp-audio-shortcode {
  width: 50%;
}
```

#### [Supported Audio format](#supported-audio-format)
