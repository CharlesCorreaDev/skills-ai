## [What are plugins?](#what-are-plugins-1)

[WordPress Plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) are PHP scripts that extend the functionality of WordPress. They enhance the features of WordPress or add entirely new features to your site. Plugins are often developed by volunteers and are usually free to the public.

Plugins are available via the [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/). Although plugins you find here are thoroughly tested and considered safe to use, they are of varying quality and are often works in progress.

### [How do they relate to WordPress core?](#how-do-they-relate-to-wordpress-core-1)

The WordPress content management system software, or WordPress core, provides the primary functionality for publishing content and managing users. Each WordPress plugin is an additional piece of software that can be easily installed to extend the functionality of WordPress core.

This allows you to customize your WordPress site with your desired functionality. Since so much functionality is provided through plugins, WordPress core is full-featured and customizable, without having to include everything for everyone.

### [What are some examples?](#what-are-some-examples-1)

Some of the more popular plugins in the [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) fall into these categories:

- Spam control
- SEO
- Data import and export
- E-commerce
- Security
- Caching

This is just a small sample. There are thousands of plugins available in the directory, so there’s a good chance you’ll find some that are useful to you.

## [Finding and Installing Plugins](#finding-and-installing-plugins-1)

### [Finding Plugins](#finding-plugins-1)

You can browse and search for plugins in the [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/). Each plugin listed there is available for download as a zip file you can upload to your WordPress site.

An alternative way to find and install plugins is from within the WordPress admin screens. Navigate to **Plugins > Add New**, and you can browse and search for plugins from within your dashboard.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TfnDziq6tE1BaXQgJygVht4KMRdRIdOQOWRMJnA3XCYfLbgq02cY3OvdMOBZ8FUCl38zaSJsJrz7la39dKcLRS3jDLLXqHsCpoXPyFw__iRIsOQnjngM_jFtN59B7i5b64VKyUYU)

Each plugin listed there has an “Install Now” button so you can easily add it to your site.

### [Plugin Compatibility](#plugin-compatibility-1)

If a plugin hasn’t been updated since the most recent update to WordPress core, it may be incompatible, or its compatibility may be unknown. You can view compatibility information about plugins from the Add Plugins page, or from the Installed Plugins list.

#### [Compatibility of New Plugins](#compatibility-of-new-plugins-1)

To learn about the compatibility of a plugin before you install it, navigate to **Plugins > Add New.** Each plugin description on this page includes a note that reads “Compatible with your version of WordPress” or “Untested with your version of WordPress.” You can click the “More Details” link to see information about this plugin’s compatibility.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/owermNk0T0VyD2wCRRL1rc78jdyVdhBPzi4wN8ClBpgzGV5hgXY5QrPlF1p3BLjwtOYtXwx9embtqtSpiVVWEWiJ5X9HB-Xui0Xoz0LizzbKaq-jDkMsLvU83c7U3vzXRu4TZe-Y)

#### [Compatibility of Installed Plugins](#compatibility-of-installed-plugins-1)

To learn about the compatibility of plugins you’ve already installed, click the “Plugins” link in the left nav of your site’s dashboard. Each item on this list should contain a “View details” link. Click this to see information about this plugin’s compatibility with different versions of WordPress.

## [Installing Plugins](#installing-plugins-1)

There are 3 ways to install WordPress plugins.

**Automatic Plugin Installation.** Any plugin available in the WordPress Plugins Directory can be installed via the built-in plugin installer.

**Upload via WordPress Admin.** You can easily add a new plugin by uploading a zip archive of the plugin from your local computer.

**Manual Plugin Installation.** In some cases, you may need to manually upload a plugin directly using an SFTP client.

### [Manual Plugin Installation](#manual-plugin-installation-1)

In rare cases, you may need to install a plugin by manually transferring the files onto the server. This is recommended only when absolutely necessary, for example when your server is not configured to allow automatic installations.

This procedure requires you to be familiar with the process of transferring files using an SFTP client. It is recommended for advanced users and developers.

Here are the detailed instructions to manually install a WordPress plugin by transferring the files onto the webserver.

1. Download the plugin zip file from the [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) and unzip it locally. For example, in the case of Gutenberg plugin, download as gutenberg.X.Y.Z.zip (X.Y.Z is version) and unzip it to get the gutenberg/ folder.
2. Transfer the extracted folder to the wp-content/plugins directory of your WordPress site via SFTP or remote file manager.
3. From the Plugins menu in the Administration Screen, click Activate for the transferred plugin.

## [Plugin Favorites](#plugin-favorites-1)

You can add a plugin to your list of favorites, and you can view and easily install another WordPress.org user’s favorite plugins.

### [Favorite a Plugin](#favorite-a-plugin-1)

1. Log in to the [WordPress Plugins Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins) using your WordPress.org ID.
2. Find the plugin you want to like and go to the plugin’s page.
3. Click the heart icon next to the Download button.

4. Once you have favorited a plugin, it will show up in your WordPress.org public profile. If you have published a review of the plugin, your rating of the plugin will also appear here.

### [View a User’s Favorite Plugins](#view-a-user-s-favorite-plugins-1)

### [Possible Resolutions](#possible-resolutions-1)

#### [Make sure that the plugin is activated after it is installed.](#make-sure-that-the-plugin-is-activated-after-it-is-installed)

1. Go to the **Plugins** > **Installed Plugins** from the WordPress admin screen.
2. Find the Plugin and click ‘Activate’.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CUpGZg3TQS4wxrO0HvJT2LTJH0nMZkgEE5gk8l2qpnM_9gTboz7Xg9yfsWA_xLFYDhhyJx-77R4_scZA2_iLIM61m-lgwXPO-bvQe3G5JVFqjLdzF_UYG5yc8lRmBiCI7o68eH9z)

#### [If you know which plugin is causing the issue:](#if-you-know-which-plugin-is-causing-the-issue)

1. Deactivate that plugin and activate it again to see if this helps.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YvqgmALVb4W0gLP0mUSF0yzffdb8odzPmxZK1FAUgcJh3K_obQpHFWFL2A6qIpx3HUrqHGiMdV6OWgpf5ib9Z4taflYqDSL7-QtuzWzMudPpBe76J4ssXNdhbgXutTc3uIm83_ea)

2. In some cases, the plugin may be buggy or incompatible. Deactivate the plugin. Search for other similar plugins, install and activate it and see it this revolves the issue.

#### [If you don’t know which plugin is causing the issue:](#if-you-don-t-know-which-plugin-is-causing-the-issue)

Sometimes problems may be caused by a conflict with different WordPress plugins. There are a few different ways you can tell which plugin is causing the issue.

- You installed a single plugin and experienced issues with your site soon after that.
- You updated a single plugin and experienced issues with your site soon after that.
- There’s an error message telling you exactly which plugin file is causing the issue.
- Try deactivating plugins one at a time until you find the one that’s causing the issue.
- Once you find the plugin that is causing the issue, you can either deactivate and activate it again to see if this helps. Or you can find other similar plugins from the [WordPress Plugins Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/), install and activate it and see if this resolves the issue.

## [Plugin Management](#plugin-management-1)

Plugins are managed from the Plugins admin screen of your WordPress site.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WgkAR2VYH-J9UuWIL5qIpwLjBIEnxSGVjE5Njfss-2UOc0KGhMMWiRgFbyZjuVi8KG1ZvjUt5JaGUZD3ZSDJKTvsabKaVG7JNAVw-8QHMHHqplQUwsSGURdFTvxQgH2IhQ_mtZ4s)

Here you will find a list of all installed plugins, whether they are active or inactive. From this screen, you can activate, deactivate and delete plugins.

Plugins listed in bold are currently active.

Each plugin on the list also contains links to further information about the plugin.

### [Must-Use Plugins](#must-use-plugins-1)

Must-use plugins (a.k.a. mu-plugins) are plugins installed in a special directory inside the content folder and which are automatically enabled.

Must-use plugins do not show in the default list of plugins on the Plugins page and cannot be disabled except by removing the plugin file from the must-use directory, which is found in wp-content/mu-plugins by default.

For more details, please refer [Must Use Plugins](article__must-use-plugins.md).

## [Developing Plugins](#developing-plugins-2)

The WordPress community relies on plugin developers to maintain a healthy and growing collection of plugins. A large part of what makes WordPress valuable is the extensive and freely available plugins.

You can help WordPress users by creating your own plugins for distribution through the WordPress plugin directory.
