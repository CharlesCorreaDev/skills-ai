### What is the Client Portal?[​](#what-is-the-client-portal "Direct link to What is the Client Portal?")

- When you send a client an invoice, the email contains a link to view the invoice online in the client portal.
- The client portal is an online self-serve dashboard for your client to see their invoices, make payments, download statements, manage subscriptions, payment methods, and more.
- Client portal access is available for all your clients. You can optionally allow anyone to register as a new client under Settings>Client Portal>Registration.
- If you enable "Client Initiated Payments" under Settings>Payment Settings, you can even allow your clients to make a payment online without you having to send an invoice (you can also set the "Minimum Payment Amount" for client-initiated payments)
- You can see how the client portal looks for your clients by clicking the "Client Portal" option:

### What is a subdomain?[​](#what-is-a-subdomain "Direct link to What is a subdomain?")

- The subdomain is used in the client portal to personalize links to match your brand. Ex., <https://your-brand.invoicing.co>
- Under Settings > Client Portal, you can setup your subdomain.
- Links generated in the system (invoices, quotes, etc.) that are sent to your clients will use the subdomain you have configured.
- If you have multiple companies, you can set a different subdomain for each company. Ex., companya.invoicing.co, companyb.invoicing.co… that way, each company has its own branding and custom link.

- You can also toggle whether taxes are inclusive or exclusive.
- You can also set a tax category for your each product. That way, you can report which tax category the tax was charge for based on the products you sold. For example, "Physical Goods", "Tax Exempt"…
