The Products API manages your catalog of reusable line items — the goods
and services you sell. Each product stores a default price, description,
tax settings, and cost, and can be referenced when building invoices,
quotes, and purchase orders to keep pricing and descriptions consistent.

### Common uses[​](#common-uses "Direct link to Common uses")

- Maintain a reusable catalog of goods and services
- Pre-fill invoice and quote line items from a product key
- Track stock quantities and notify on low inventory
