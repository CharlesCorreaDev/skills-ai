E-invoicing is the practice of sending invoices as structured, machine-readable documents rather than PDFs or paper — so your customer's accounting system can ingest them directly without anyone retyping figures. Adoption is accelerating: many jurisdictions have moved, or are moving, to mandate it for B2B and B2G transactions, and the EU has signalled that all member states will be on a standard PEPPOL network implementation by 2030.

Invoice Ninja has supported UBL-format invoices for some time, and now covers a range of e-invoice formats along with direct delivery over the PEPPOL network. Every supported standard can be downloaded straight from a regular invoice you create in Invoice Ninja — so enabling e-invoicing doesn't change how you invoice day-to-day, it only changes the shape of the document that goes out.

In some regions the invoice travels directly from you to your customer. In others — Italy is the obvious example — it has to be routed through a government clearinghouse (SDI in Italy's case), which then forwards it to the customer. If you're in one of those jurisdictions, both parties need to be registered with the relevant body, and you'll need to start the process of obtaining a government routing ID if you haven't already.

## E-Invoice Standards[​](#e-invoice-standards "Direct link to E-Invoice Standards")

The list of supported formats is:

- [PEPPOL (Universal - Cross industry / border)](#peppol)
- [ZUGFeRD - XRechung (Germany)](#zugferd)
- [Facturae (Spain)](#facturae)
- [Verifactu (Spain)](#verifactu)
- [FatturaPA (Italy)](#fatturapa)
- [FACT1 (Romania)](#fact1)
- [EN16931 (Generic)](#en16931)

## PEPPOL[​](#peppol "Direct link to PEPPOL")

PEPPOL is the closest thing to a universal e-invoicing standard — a cross-border network that lets businesses in participating countries exchange invoices without bilateral integrations. Invoice Ninja operates its own PEPPOL access point, available to both hosted and self-hosted users, which routes your e-invoices onto the network.

## Getting Started[​](#getting-started "Direct link to Getting Started")

Each jurisdiction has its own set of fields that *must* be populated for an e-invoice to validate. In Germany, for example, a Payment Means field is required — that's the sending party's payment details such as the IBAN and related bank metadata. Without it the e-invoice cannot be generated or sent. During onboarding you'll have the chance to validate your data so nothing blocks delivery later.

If you're on our hosted platform we'll send you region-specific onboarding instructions. Self-hosted users proxy their e-invoices through our hosted platform: you register your service with Invoice Ninja, we create a legal entity ID for you, and your system then routes e-invoices through ours. For security and data privacy, the proxy only relays the data that is sent — it's never stored on our side.

## Preparing Your Installation[​](#preparing-your-installation "Direct link to Preparing Your Installation")

A few things are worth knowing before you flip e-invoicing on, because they change how you build and handle invoices going forward:

1. All taxes must be applied at the line level. Invoice-level (total) taxes are not supported with e-invoicing. See [Line-Level vs Invoice-Level Tax](docs__user-guide.md#line-level-vs-invoice-level-tax) for the reasoning behind the two modes.
2. If you don't charge VAT or tax on your invoices, you still need to apply a tax code or reason — for example, Cross Border exemption, or seller with no VAT number. The e-invoice schema requires an explicit answer to "why no tax?" rather than silence.
3. Once an invoice has been *sent* it can never be modified. If something needs to change, create a new invoice or credit with the correction. This is a compliance rule, not a UI limitation — a sent e-invoice is effectively a legal document in transit.
4. To correct or reduce a sent PEPPOL invoice, you can create either a dedicated credit note or a negative invoice. Both are supported. See [Correcting a Sent PEPPOL Invoice](#correcting-a-sent-peppol-invoice) below.

### Correcting a Sent PEPPOL Invoice[​](#correcting-a-sent-peppol-invoice "Direct link to Correcting a Sent PEPPOL Invoice")

You can correct a sent PEPPOL invoice in either of these ways:

#### Create a Credit Note[​](#create-a-credit-note "Direct link to Create a Credit Note")

This is the simplest option when you are crediting an existing invoice:

1. Open the original invoice.
2. Open its **Actions** menu and select **Credit Note**.
3. Review the new credit. The client, line items, and original invoice reference are filled in for you.
4. Save the credit, then open its **E-Invoice** tab.
5. Check that the original invoice is shown under **Reference** and resolve any validation messages.
6. Select **Send**.

#### Create a Negative Invoice[​](#create-a-negative-invoice "Direct link to Create a Negative Invoice")

A negative invoice remains valid for PEPPOL and is sent as a credit note. Create a new invoice for the amount you need to reverse, using a negative **Quantity** and a positive **Unit Price** so the invoice total is negative.

Unit prices must never be negative

Always enter a positive **Unit Price** on PEPPOL invoices and credits.

- For a negative invoice, use a negative **Quantity** with a positive **Unit Price**.
- For a dedicated credit, use positive quantities and positive unit prices. The credit itself represents the reduction.

A negative unit price will prevent the PEPPOL document from validating.

## Can I receive e-invoices?[​](#can-i-receive-e-invoices "Direct link to Can I receive e-invoices?")

Yes. On our hosted platform this is automatic. Self-hosted users receive inbound e-invoices via a cron that polls Invoice Ninja servers every four hours.

## Jurisdiction Specific Requirements[​](#jurisdiction-specific-requirements "Direct link to Jurisdiction Specific Requirements")

Every PEPPOL country layers a few of its own rules on top of the standard. The sections below cover what each one expects in addition to the baseline fields.

### AT - Austria[​](#at---austria "Direct link to AT - Austria")

#### CustomerAssignedAccountID - Mandatory for GOV clients[​](#customerassignedaccountid---mandatory-for-gov-clients "Direct link to CustomerAssignedAccountID - Mandatory for GOV clients")

When you're billing a government body in Austria, the e-invoice has to include:

AccountingSupplierParty > CustomerAssignedAccountID

This is the ID of the department within the government that the e-invoice will be routed to — without it the system has no way to direct the document internally.

### BE - Belgium[​](#be---belgium "Direct link to BE - Belgium")

No additional requirements. When your legal entity ID is created it is automatically synced with HERMES.

### CH - Switzerland[​](#ch---switzerland "Direct link to CH - Switzerland")

#### Payment Means - Mandatory[​](#payment-means---mandatory "Direct link to Payment Means - Mandatory")

The payment means tells the recipient how you'd like to be paid. Using the [Payment Means](#payment-means-codelist) codelist, you must include at least ONE payment means of the Credit Transfer type.

```
<cac:PaymentMeans>

<cbc:PaymentMeansCode>30</cbc:PaymentMeansCode> <!-- code from payment means code list Credit Transfer-->

<cac:PayeeFinancialAccount>

<cbc:ID>DE89370400440532013000</cbc:ID> <!-- IBAN CODE -->

<cac:FinancialInstitutionBranch>

<cbc:ID>DEUTDEMMXXX</cbc:ID> <!-- BIC CODE -->

</cac:FinancialInstitutionBranch>

</cac:PayeeFinancialAccount>

</cac:PaymentMeans>
```

### DE - Germany[​](#de---germany "Direct link to DE - Germany")

#### Payment Means - Mandatory[​](#payment-means---mandatory-1 "Direct link to Payment Means - Mandatory")

The payment means contains information on how the seller wishes to be paid. Consult the [Payment Means](#payment-means-codelist) codelist for the right code — for example, to declare a bank account for credit transfer:

```
<cac:PaymentMeans>

<cbc:PaymentMeansCode>30</cbc:PaymentMeansCode> <!-- code from payment means code list Credit Transfer-->

<cac:PayeeFinancialAccount>

<cbc:ID>DE89370400440532013000</cbc:ID> <!-- IBAN CODE -->

<cac:FinancialInstitutionBranch>

<cbc:ID>DEUTDEMMXXX</cbc:ID> <!-- BIC CODE -->

</cac:FinancialInstitutionBranch>

</cac:PayeeFinancialAccount>

</cac:PaymentMeans>
```

### ES - Spain[​](#es---spain "Direct link to ES - Spain")

\*\*\* Government registration required \*\*\*

#### Payment Means - Mandatory[​](#payment-means---mandatory-2 "Direct link to Payment Means - Mandatory")

The payment means contains information on how the seller wishes to be paid. Using the [Payment Means](#payment-means-codelist) codelist, you must include at least ONE payment means of the Credit Transfer type.

```
<cac:PaymentMeans>

<cbc:PaymentMeansCode>30</cbc:PaymentMeansCode> <!-- code from payment means code list Credit Transfer-->

<cac:PayeeFinancialAccount>

<cbc:ID>DE89370400440532013000</cbc:ID> <!-- IBAN CODE -->

<cac:FinancialInstitutionBranch>

<cbc:ID>DEUTDEMMXXX</cbc:ID> <!-- BIC CODE -->

</cac:FinancialInstitutionBranch>

</cac:PayeeFinancialAccount>

</cac:PaymentMeans>
```

#### Due Date - Mandatory[​](#due-date---mandatory "Direct link to Due Date - Mandatory")

The invoice MUST have a due date set.

#### Government bound e-invoices[​](#government-bound-e-invoices "Direct link to Government bound e-invoices")

If sending to a Spanish government body, the property:

AccountingCustomerParty > PublicIdentifiers

must be set.

### FI - Finland[​](#fi---finland "Direct link to FI - Finland")

Finland requires some special mapping of relevant IDs, the following client fields should be used for these:

| Field | Scheme | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Routing ID | FI:OPID (operator) | `003702554123` |
| ID Number | FI:OVT | `003703854172` |
| VAT Number | FI:VAT | `FI06874602` |

### FR - France[​](#fr---france "Direct link to FR - France")

The SIRET / 0009 identifier of the final recipient must be included in the `invoice.accountingCustomerParty.publicIdentifiers` array.

### IT - Italy[​](#it---italy "Direct link to IT - Italy")

No special requirements.

### NL - Netherlands[​](#nl---netherlands "Direct link to NL - Netherlands")

When sending to government bodies the following property must be configured:

accountingSupplierParty > party > contact > email

### PL - Poland[​](#pl---poland "Direct link to PL - Poland")

\*\*\* Government registration required \*\*\*

### RO - Romania[​](#ro---romania "Direct link to RO - Romania")

\*\*\* Government registration required \*\*\*

#### Special codes for county[​](#special-codes-for-county "Direct link to Special codes for county")

The county field for a Romanian address must use the ISO3166-2:RO codes — for example, "RO-AB" or "RO-AR". Don't omit the country prefix, as validation will reject the document.

#### Special codes for city[​](#special-codes-for-city "Direct link to Special codes for city")

For county RO-B the city field must be one of SECTOR1 through SECTOR6.

### SE - Sweden[​](#se---sweden "Direct link to SE - Sweden")

Receiver needs to be registered with Svefaktura to receive the e-invoice.

## ZUGFeRD[​](#zugferd "Direct link to ZUGFeRD")

![CBA PowerBoard](/assets/images/einvoices/zugferd.png)

ZUGFeRD is the German hybrid format — a regular PDF with the structured e-invoice XML embedded inside it, which means a single document works for both humans and machines. Turn it on from **Settings > E-Invoice**, select the X format variant you need, and save. If you'd like the XML carried inside the PDF itself rather than as a separate file, toggle **Merge E-Invoice and PDF** before saving.

\*\* NOTE \*\*

ZUGFeRD does not accept negative-valued invoices. If you've historically used a negative invoice to represent a credit note, that won't work here — you'll need to create a dedicated credit note with matching *positive* values reflecting the credit you're assigning. See [Credits](docs__user-guide__credits.md) for how credit notes work.

## Facturae[​](#facturae "Direct link to Facturae")

Spanish Facturae documents are supported and generate valid output. These can be uploaded into the FACe system.

## Verifactu (alpha)[​](#verifactu "Direct link to Verifactu (alpha)")

Support for Verifactu is nearing release. Your day-to-day invoicing flow inside Invoice Ninja doesn't change, but there are a few important behaviours to be aware of because Verifactu is a submission-based system with stricter document lifecycle rules:

**1. Power of Attorney.** For Invoice Ninja to submit invoices to AEAT on your behalf, AEAT requires you to grant permission. This is done directly on the AEAT website by searching for Invoice Ninja in the list of registered providers.

**2. Document submission process.** Once an invoice has been submitted it cannot be modified — the document moves into a locked state. You can still cancel a submitted document using **Cancel** or **Delete** on the invoice. If you need to issue a rectification invoice (a credit note), use the **Rectify** menu option — this generates a negative invoice linked to the original. Rectification invoices can themselves be cancelled, which removes the credit note linked to the invoice.

**NOTE**

Once an invoice has a rectification invoice (credit note) applied to it, it cannot be deleted unless all attached credit notes have also been cancelled or deleted first.

**3. Verifactu tab.** After saving an invoice on the edit invoice page, a Verifactu tab appears with additional information about that invoice's validation status.

**4. Mandatory information.** For invoices to Spanish customers you MUST enter a NIF for the client — this is an AEAT requirement. The only exception is when no NIF is available, in which case the client's passport number can be stored in the **ID Number** field on the client record (see [Clients](docs__user-guide__clients.md)). AEAT requires census data on the recipient, so sending will fail for any client missing these details.

## FatturaPA[​](#fatturapa "Direct link to FatturaPA")

Italian e-invoices can be generated, but the SDI connection isn't live yet so this format is not currently production ready.

## FACT1[​](#fact1 "Direct link to FACT1")

Romanian e-invoices can be generated, but the delivery connection isn't live yet so this format is not currently production ready.

## EN16931[​](#en16931 "Direct link to EN16931")

Standard EN16931 documents can be generated and downloaded as needed. This is the generic European norm that underpins most national formats, so it's a useful fallback when you need a compliant structured invoice without committing to a specific country profile.
