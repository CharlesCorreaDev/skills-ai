## Stripe Integration[​](#stripe-integration "Direct link to Stripe Integration")

In v5 of Invoice Ninja we have introduced Stripe Connect using OAuth. This integration provides a secure way to integrate your Stripe account into Invoice Ninja.

When you migrate your data across, we automatically create your Stripe account, however we need you to authorize via OAuth your Stripe account with Invoice Ninja.

To do this, navigate to Settings > Payment Settings. Click on Stripe Connect you'll see the following:

## Stripe Webhooks[​](#stripe-webhooks "Direct link to Stripe Webhooks")

It is highly recommended that you configure webhooks that allow Stripe to communicate with Invoice Ninja.

In cases where the customer leaves prior to the transaction completing or a loss of communication between Stripe and Invoice Ninja. Webhooks can self heal any transactions that are incomplete.

You can find your webhook details on the Stripe overview page in Settings > Payment Settings > Configure Gateways > Stripe
