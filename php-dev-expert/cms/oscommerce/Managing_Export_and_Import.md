#### **4) Required File Structure Rules**

- The **Products Model** column (or its equivalent listed above) is **mandatory**. This field is used to **find and update existing records**. If missing, duplicates will be created.
- All **other columns are optional**:
  - If a column exists and contains data → the data will be updated.
  - If a column is missing → the original data will remain unchanged.

#### **5) Special Requirements for Certain Data Types**

When importing data for:

- **Assign products to categories**
- **Attributes**
- **Images**
- **Properties**

The product-related rows must be **grouped (sorted) together**.

If the product rows are **not grouped**, the system will treat missing rows as deletions and remove data.

#### **6) Example for Updating Prices**

A minimal price update file may contain **only two columns**, for example:
