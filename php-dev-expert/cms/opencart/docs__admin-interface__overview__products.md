## Choosing the Right Product Type

#### Step 1: Analyze Your Product

Consider what type of product you're selling:

- **Physical goods** with no variations → Standard Product
- **Configurable items** with options → Variant Product
- **Recurring services** → Subscription Product

**Quick Decision Guide:**

- Single item, fixed price? → Standard Product
- Multiple sizes/colors? → Variant Product
- Monthly billing? → Subscription Product

#### Step 2: Understand Product Requirements

Evaluate what features you need:

- **Standard Products**: Basic pricing, single inventory
- **Variant Products**: Multiple options, separate pricing and inventory
- **Subscription Products**: Recurring billing, trial periods

**Important Considerations:**

- Variant products require option setup first
- Subscription products need payment gateway support
- Standard products are simplest to manage

#### Step 3: Plan Your Product Structure

Prepare your product information:

- **Standard Products**: Single product details
- **Variant Products**: Master product + variant combinations
- **Subscription Products**: Billing cycles and trial options

**Pro Tip:** Start with standard products if you're new to OpenCart, then explore variants and subscriptions as your business grows.
