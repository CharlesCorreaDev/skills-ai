Log in to your admin dashboard and go to **System → Settings**.

Option Settings Tab

Because this tab contains many settings, they are grouped into logical sub-sections. Use the dropdowns below to explore each category.

### Storefront Display & Catalog

**Products & Reviews**

**Catalog Display Settings**

## Common Tasks

### Enabling Guest Checkout

To allow customers to purchase without creating an account:

1. Navigate to the **Account & Checkout** section.
2. Set **Guest Checkout** to **Yes**.
3. Ensure **Stock Checkout** (under Stock & Inventory) is also set to **Yes** if you want to allow guest purchases of out-of-stock items.

### Forcing Login to View Prices

If you run a B2B store and want to hide prices from the general public:

1. Navigate to the **Account & Checkout** section.
2. Set **Login Display Prices** to **Yes**.
3. Prices will now only be visible to customers who are logged into their accounts.

## Best Practices

**Optimizing Conversion**

**Frictionless Checkout**

- **Guest Checkout**: Enabling guest checkout is one of the most effective ways to reduce cart abandonment.
- **Checkout Terms**: Keep your terms clear and link to a page that opens in a popup so customers don't leave the checkout flow.

**Security & Trust**

**Building Credibility**

- **Reviews**: Only enable guest reviews if you have a strong anti-spam filter or manual approval process.
- **Stock Checkout**: Only allow stock checkout if you are confident your suppliers can fulfill backorders quickly.

**Tax Configuration** ⚠️ If your legal region requires you to show prices with tax by law, ensure "Display Prices With Tax" is set to \*\*Yes\*\*. Failure to do so may lead to legal issues.

## Troubleshooting

**Prices are not showing on the storefront**

**Display and Tax Settings**

- **Check Login Settings**: Verify if **Login Display Prices** is set to **Yes**. If it is, only logged-in users can see prices.
- **Tax Settings**: If taxes are not appearing, ensure **Display Prices With Tax** is enabled and your Tax Classes are correctly assigned to products.

**Guest Checkout is not appearing**

**Requirements and Configuration**

- **Verify Setting**: Ensure **Guest Checkout** is set to **Yes**.
- **Check Cart Contents**: Guest checkout is automatically disabled if the shopping cart contains a **Downloadable Product** (as these require an account for future access).
- **Terms Agreement**: Ensure you have selected a valid **Checkout Terms** page; if the page is missing or disabled, the checkout flow may fail.
