#### Navigate to Settings

Log in to your admin dashboard and go to **System → Settings**.

2

#### Edit Store

Find your store in the list (usually "Your Store" by default) and click the **Edit** (blue pencil) button on the right.

3

#### Select General Tab

By default, the **General** tab will be the first one visible.

General Settings Tab

Below are the key fields found in the General tab:

### Store Identity

- **Store Name**: **(Required)** The official name of your store as it appears throughout your website.
- **Theme**: Select the default theme for your storefront. Third-party themes will appear here if installed.
- **Default Layout**: The fallback layout used when no specific layout is assigned to a page.
- **Logo**: The main logo that appears in the header of your storefront and on invoices.
- **Icon**: Also known as a "Favicon". This is the small image that appears in the browser tab next to your store's title.

### Meta Tags (SEO)

- **Meta Title**: **(Required)** The title of your store as it will appear in browser tabs and search engine results. This is critical for SEO.
- **Meta Tag Description**: A brief summary of your store (160 characters recommended) for search engines.
- **Meta Tag Keywords**: Keywords related to your store (less important for modern SEO, but still available).

**Note**: If you are running a multi-store setup, each store can have its own unique General settings, allowing you to have different store names, themes, logos, and meta tags for different brands.

## Common Tasks

### Uploading a New Logo

To change the main logo of your store:

1. Click on the existing **Logo** image or the placeholder.
2. The **Image Manager** will open. Upload your new logo file.
3. Double-click the uploaded image to select it.
4. Click **Save** at the top right.

### Optimizing Meta Tags for SEO

To improve your store's search engine visibility:

1. Write a compelling **Meta Title** (50-60 characters) that includes your primary brand name.
2. Craft a concise **Meta Tag Description** (around 160 characters) that summarizes your store and encourages clicks.
3. If using **Meta Tag Keywords**, focus on 3-5 high-relevance terms.

## Best Practices

**SEO Optimization**

**Meta Data Tips**

- **Meta Title**: Keep it between 50-60 characters. Include your primary brand name.
- **Meta Description**: Write a compelling call-to-action to increase your click-through rate (CTR) from search results.
- **Keywords**: Focus on 3-5 high-relevance terms if you choose to use this field.

**Visual Branding**

**Logo & Icon Guidelines**

- **Logo Format**: Use transparent PNG or SVG formats for the best look on different background colors.
- **File Size**: Keep your logo file size small (under 100KB) to ensure fast page loading.
- **Favicon**: Use a simple, high-contrast icon that is recognizable even at very small sizes (16x16 or 32x32 pixels).

**Logo Visibility** ⚠️ If your logo doesn't appear on the storefront, clear the theme cache and verify the image file was uploaded correctly in the Image Manager.

## Troubleshooting

**Changes are not appearing on the storefront**

**Cache and Theme Issues**

- **Cache Issue**: Your browser or a server-side cache (like Cloudflare or an OpenCart cache extension) might be showing an old version. Clear your browser cache or the OpenCart theme cache.
- **Theme Specifics**: Some custom themes might use their own settings instead of the default OpenCart General settings. Check your theme's documentation if changes don't reflect.

**Meta tags are not showing in search results**

**SEO and Cache Issues**

- **Search Engine Crawling**: It may take days or weeks for search engines to re-crawl your site and index updated meta tags.
- **Cache**: Clear your store's cache and any server-side caching (like Cloudflare) to ensure the new meta tags are served to visitors.
- **Theme Override**: Some custom themes may override OpenCart's default meta tag handling. Check your theme's documentation.
