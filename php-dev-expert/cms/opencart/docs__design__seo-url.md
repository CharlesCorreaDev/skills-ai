*Video: Managing SEO URLs in OpenCart 4*

## Introduction

SEO URLs in OpenCart 4 allow you to create clean, readable URLs that improve search engine rankings and user experience. Instead of complex URLs with multiple parameters, you can use keyword-based URLs that are easier for both customers and search engines to understand.

SEO URL List

The SEO URL list displays all the URL aliases currently configured in your store. From here, you can:

- **Add New**: Create a new SEO URL mapping
- **Edit**: Modify existing mappings
- **Delete**: Remove SEO URL mappings
- **Filter**: Search for specific mappings by keyword, route, or language

**Pro Tip**: Use the filter feature to quickly find specific URL mappings when managing a large number of aliases across different stores and languages.

## Enabling SEO URLs

Before custom SEO URLs will work on your storefront, you must enable the feature in your system settings.

1

#### Access Store Settings

1. Log in to your OpenCart admin panel.
2. Navigate to **System → Settings**.
3. Click the **Edit** button next to your store.

2

#### Enable SEO URLs

1. Go to the **Server** tab.
2. Find the **Use SEO URL** option.
3. Set it to **Yes**.
4. Click **Save**.

3

#### Configure Server Rewriting

Depending on your server, you may need to:

- **Apache**: Rename `htaccess.txt` to `.htaccess` in your root directory and ensure `mod_rewrite` is enabled.
- **Nginx**: Add specific rewrite rules to your server configuration block.
- **IIS**: Install the URL Rewrite module and configure `web.config`.

**Server Configuration Required** ⚠️ SEO URLs require proper server rewrite configuration. Without it, your friendly URLs will return 404 "Not Found" errors.

## Creating/Editing SEO URLs

When you create or edit an SEO URL mapping, you will fill out a form with the following fields:

### Mapping Configuration

- **Store**: Select which store this mapping applies to (for multi-store setups).
- **Language**: Select which language this keyword is for (for multi-language setups).
- **Key**: The URL query parameter key (e.g., `route`, `product_id`, `category_id`).
- **Value**: The value for the key (e.g., `product/product`, `42`, `20`).
- **Keyword**: The friendly URL alias you want to use (e.g., `iphone-15`).
- **Sort Order**: Controls priority if multiple keywords match the same route.

**Key & Value Pairs**: For a typical product page, you would have two entries:

1. Key: `route`, Value: `product/product`
2. Key: `product_id`, Value: `42`

**Keyword Guidelines**: Use only lowercase characters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and hyphens (-) or underscores (\_). Use a forward slash (/) for nested paths like `electronics/phones`.

## Best Practices

**URL Structure & Strategy**

**SEO URL Guidelines**

**Structure Guidelines:**

- **Keep it Simple**: Short, descriptive URLs perform better.
- **Use Keywords**: Include relevant keywords naturally in the URL.
- **Hyphens over Underscores**: Search engines prefer hyphens as word separators.
- **Consistency**: Use lowercase consistently to avoid case-sensitivity issues on some servers.

**Optimization:**

- **Avoid Parameters**: Keep URLs clean without unnecessary query parameters.
- **Hierarchy**: Use forward slashes to indicate category depth (e.g., `/clothing/men/shirts`).
- **Breadcrumb Alignment**: Try to make URLs reflect the site's logical structure.

**SEO Tip**: A well-structured URL like `/electronics/laptops/macbook-pro` is much better for SEO than `/index.php?route=product/product&path=20_27&product_id=45`.

**Multi-Store & Multi-Language**

**Internationalization Best Practices**

**Localization:**

- **Localized Keywords**: Create keywords in the local language for each active language (e.g., `/about-us` vs `/sobre-nosotros`).
- **Store Specificity**: If you have different branding for different stores, use store-specific keywords.
- **Consistency**: Maintain a similar URL structure across languages where possible.

**Hreflang Support**: OpenCart automatically handles the technical SEO aspects of multi-language URLs, but you must provide the localized keywords.

## Common Tasks

1

#### Creating a Custom Alias for a Page

1. Navigate to **Design → SEO URL**.
2. Click **Add New**.
3. Select the **Store** and **Language**.
4. Enter `route` for the **Key** and the page route (e.g., `information/contact`) for the **Value**.
5. Enter your desired **Keyword** (e.g., `contact-us`).
6. Click **Save**.

2

#### Fixing a 404 Error on SEO URLs

1. Verify "Use SEO URL" is set to "Yes" in System Settings.
2. Check that `.htaccess` exists and has the correct rewrite rules.
3. Ensure the keyword is unique and doesn't conflict with other mappings.
4. Clear the system cache.

## Warnings and Limitations

**Critical Warnings**

- **Keyword Uniqueness**: Keywords MUST be unique for each store/language combination.
- **Changing Keywords**: Changing an existing keyword will break old links. Set up 301 redirects if necessary.
- **Special Characters**: Avoid using spaces or special characters like `?`, `&`, or `%` in keywords.
- **Reserved Routes**: Do not use keywords that conflict with actual file names or directory names in your root folder.

## Troubleshooting

**SEO URLs Not Working (404 Error)**

**Problem: Friendly URLs return a 404 page**

**Diagnostic Steps:**

1. **Setting Check**: Go to System > Settings > Server and confirm "Use SEO URL" is Enabled.
2. **Server Configuration**: Check if `.htaccess` (Apache) or server config (Nginx) is present.
3. **Keyword Check**: Verify the keyword actually exists in Design > SEO URL.

**Quick Solutions:**

- Rename `htaccess.txt` to `.htaccess`.
- Ask your host if `mod_rewrite` is enabled.
- Re-save the SEO URL mapping.

**Duplicate Keywords**

**Problem: Error when saving a keyword**

**Diagnostic Steps:**

1. **Search**: Use the filter on the SEO URL list to find if the keyword is already in use.
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Check if the keyword is used by another category, product, or information page.

**Quick Solutions:**

- Use a different, more specific keyword.
- Delete the old mapping if it's no longer needed.
