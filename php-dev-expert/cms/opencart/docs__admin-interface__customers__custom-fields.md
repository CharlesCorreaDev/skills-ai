## Managing Existing Custom Fields

### Editing a Field

1. From the custom field list, click **Edit** (pencil icon)
2. Modify field settings as needed
3. Click **Save** to update

**Field Type Changes** ⚠️

Changing field types after data has been collected may cause data loss or conversion issues. Consider creating a new field instead of changing types.

### Deleting a Field

### Reordering Fields

Adjust the **Sort Order** value to control display order. Fields with lower sort order numbers appear first in forms.

**Sort Order Tips** 🔢

- Group related fields with consecutive numbers
- Test form appearance after reordering

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Field not appearing in form 🔍**

**Possible Causes:**

- Field not assigned to customer group
- Incorrect location setting
- Field disabled (sort order set to hidden)

**Solutions:**

1. Check customer group assignment in field settings
2. Verify location matches intended form (Account, Address, Affiliate)
3. Ensure sort order is set (not empty or negative)

**Validation errors ⚠️**

**Possible Causes:**

- Input doesn't match field type (e.g., text in email field)
- Required field left empty
- Custom regex pattern mismatch

**Solutions:**

1. Verify field configuration matches expected input type
2. Check if field is marked as required
3. Test validation rules with sample data

**File uploads failing 📎**

**Possible Causes:**

- File type not allowed
- File size exceeds limit
- Server permissions or storage issues

**Solutions:**

1. Check allowed file types in field settings
2. Verify maximum file size limit
3. Ensure server upload directory has proper permissions

**Data not saving 💾**

**Possible Causes:**

- Required field validation failing
- Database constraints or limits
- Form submission errors

**Solutions:**

1. Check if field is marked as required but left empty
2. Verify database connection and table structure
3. Test with different browsers/devices

**Performance Considerations** ⚡

- Large numbers of custom fields can slow down registration and profile forms

- Consider pagination or progressive loading for forms with many fields

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy 🔒

### File Upload Security 📎

- Store uploaded files in secure, non-web-accessible locations

### Input Validation 🛡️
