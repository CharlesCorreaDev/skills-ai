**Organizing Your Customers** Customer Groups allow you to categorize customers for targeted marketing, special pricing, and permission management in OpenCart 4.

## Introduction

Customer Groups in OpenCart 4 enable you to organize customers into logical categories. This powerful feature allows you to apply different settings, pricing, and permissions to different groups of customers, making it ideal for businesses that serve multiple customer segments.

## Default Customer Groups

OpenCart 4 comes with three default customer groups:

Create separate groups for retail and wholesale customers with different pricing rules:

- **Retail Group**: Standard pricing, no approval required
- **Wholesale Group**: Special pricing, approval required for new accounts

**2. Geographic Segmentation 🌍**

Create groups for customers in different regions or countries:

- **Domestic Customers**: Standard shipping rates
- **International Customers**: Higher shipping rates, different tax rules

**3. Customer Tier System 🥇**

Implement loyalty tiers based on purchase history:

- **Bronze**: New customers, basic benefits
- **Silver**: Regular customers, enhanced benefits
- **Gold**: VIP customers, premium benefits

**4. Business Customer Management 🏢**

Special groups for business customers:

- **Corporate Accounts**: Company-specific pricing, approval required
- **Government Accounts**: Special terms, documentation requirements

## Assigning Customers to Groups

**During Registration 📝**

Customers select their group during registration (if multiple groups are available and don't require approval).

**Manual Assignment 👤**

Admins can assign customers to groups:

1. Go to **Customers → Customers**
2. Edit a customer
3. Change the **Customer Group** in the General tab
4. Save the changes

## Integration with Other Features

**Custom Fields 📝**

Customer groups determine which custom fields are shown during registration and in customer profiles:

1. Create custom fields in **Customers → Custom Fields**
2. Assign fields to specific customer groups
3. Fields only appear for customers in those groups

**Pricing Rules 💰**

Use customer groups with special pricing extensions to offer group-specific pricing.

**Marketing Campaigns 📧**

Target email campaigns and promotions to specific customer groups.

**Permission Management 🔒**

Control access to certain store features based on customer group membership.

## Best Practices

**Group Strategy** 🎯

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic groups (Retail, Wholesale) and expand as needed
2. **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive names that indicate the group's purpose
3. **Minimal Groups**: Create only as many groups as necessary to avoid complexity

**Approval Workflow** ⚠️

1. **Selective Approval**: Use approval requirements only for high-value or sensitive groups
2. **Clear Communication**: Inform customers about approval requirements during registration
3. **Timely Processing**: Regularly check and process approval requests

**Group Maintenance** 🛠️

1. **Regular Review**: Periodically review group assignments and settings
2. **Clean Up**: Remove unused groups to simplify management
3. **Documentation**: Keep notes on group purposes and rules

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Group not appearing in registration 🔍**

**Solution:** Check group settings: Approval Required should be "No" for self-selection

**Cannot delete group 🗑️**

**Solution:** Ensure no customers are assigned to the group. Reassign customers first

**Custom fields not showing 📝**

**Solution:** Verify custom fields are assigned to the correct customer groups

**Approval emails not sending 📧**

**Solution:** Check email configuration and notification settings

**Performance Considerations** ⚡

- Large numbers of customer groups can slow down registration and admin interfaces
- Consider using extensions for advanced group management if you need many groups
- Regularly clean up inactive groups and customer assignments
