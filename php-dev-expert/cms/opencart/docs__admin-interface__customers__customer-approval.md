**Controlled Customer Registration** 🔒 The Customer Approval system allows you to manually review and approve new customer registrations before they can access your store, perfect for B2B portals, exclusive memberships, and high-security environments.

## Introduction

Customer Approval in OpenCart 4 provides a controlled registration process where new customer accounts require manual approval by an administrator. This feature is essential for stores that need to vet customers before granting access, such as B2B portals, exclusive memberships, or high-security environments.

## How Customer Approval Works

The approval process follows a structured workflow:

1

**Step 1: Customer Registration**

Customer completes the registration form on your storefront.

**Outcome:** Registration is submitted to the system.

2

**Step 2: Approval Check**

System checks if the customer's selected group requires approval.

**Possible paths:**

- **No approval required** → Account activated immediately
- **Approval required** → Account placed in pending approval queue

3

**Step 3: Admin Review (If Required)**

Administrator reviews the pending registration in the admin panel.

**Review includes:**

- Customer information
- Custom field data (if applicable)
- Any additional registration details

4

**Step 4: Decision & Notification**

Administrator makes a decision:

**Approve:**

- Account activated
- Customer receives approval notification email
- Customer can now log in and shop

**Deny:**

- Registration rejected
- Customer receives rejection notification email
- Registration data removed from system

## Accessing Customer Approval

To access the Customer Approval interface:

1. Log in to your OpenCart admin panel
2. Navigate to **Customers → Customer Approval**
3. You'll see the approval list with pending requests

**Deny Request** ❌

## Bulk Approval Operations

**Batch Processing 🔄**

To process multiple requests at once:

1. **Select requests** - Check boxes next to the requests you want to process
2. **Choose action** - From the bulk action dropdown:

   - **Approve Selected** ✅ - Approve all selected requests

**Bulk Operation Warning** ⚠️

Bulk operations apply to **all selected requests**. Double-check your selections before proceeding, as actions cannot be undone.

**Efficiency Tip** ⚡

- **Compliance Data**: Age verification, tax exemption status

**Enhanced Decision-Making** 💡

Use custom field data to make informed approval decisions. For example, require business registration documents for wholesale accounts.
