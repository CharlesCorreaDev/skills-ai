*Video: Using the Language Editor in OpenCart 4*

## Introduction

The Language Editor in OpenCart 4 is a powerful tool that allows you to override any text string in your store without modifying the physical language files. This ensures your customizations are "update-safe," meaning they won't be lost when you upgrade OpenCart or your extensions. It's the ideal way to customize branding, improve messaging, or fix translation errors.

Language Editor List

The Language Editor list shows all the active translation overrides in your store. From this interface, you can:

- **Add New**: Create a new translation override.
- **Edit**: Modify an existing override.
- **Delete**: Remove an override and revert to the default text.
- **Filter**: Search for specific overrides by store, language, or route.

**Pro Tip**: Overrides are stored in the database. If you want to revert to the original text provided by OpenCart or an extension, simply delete the entry in the Language Editor.

## Creating a Translation Override

To change a specific piece of text on your storefront or admin panel, follow these steps:

1

#### Access the Editor

1. Log in to your OpenCart admin panel.
2. Navigate to **Design → Language Editor**.
3. Click the **Add New** (+) button.

2

#### Select Route and Key

1. **Store**: Choose the store where the change should apply.
2. **Language**: Select the target language.
3. **Route**: Select the page or module where the text is located (e.g., `common/header` for the header).
4. **Key**: Select the specific text variable from the dropdown. OpenCart 4 automatically populates this list based on the Route you selected.

3

#### Set New Value

1. **Default**: This field shows the current text for reference.
2. **Value**: Enter your new custom text.
3. Click **Save**.

### Configuration Fields

- **Store**: Allows you to have different text for the same item on different sub-stores.
- **Language**: Essential for multi-language stores to ensure the right translation is updated.
- **Route**: The internal path to the language file. For example, `checkout/checkout` contains strings for the checkout page.
- **Key**: The specific identifier for the text string. In OpenCart 4, this is a searchable dropdown, making it easy to find the exact string you need.
- **Default**: Displays the original text from the language file so you know what you are changing.
- **Value**: Your custom text. This is what will be displayed on the storefront.

**Finding the Route**: If you're unsure which route contains the text you want to change, look at the URL of the page. For a product page, the route is usually `product/product`. For the contact page, it's `information/contact`.

## Best Practices

**Customization Strategy**

**Branding & Consistency**

**Consistent Tone:**

- **Brand Voice**: Use the Language Editor to ensure all buttons and messages match your brand's personality (e.g., changing "Add to Cart" to "Add to Bag").
- **Terminology**: Use consistent terms throughout the store to avoid confusing customers.
- **Clarity**: Rewrite technical or vague error messages into helpful, user-friendly instructions.

**Maintenance:**

- **Keep it Minimal**: Only override strings you actually need to change to keep the list manageable.
- **Document Changes**: Keep a note of why certain strings were changed, especially for legal or compliance reasons.

**UX Tip**: Small changes like changing "Register Account" to "Join the Club" can significantly impact user engagement and conversion rates.

**Multi-Language & Multi-Store**

**Global Management**

**Localization:**

- **Regional Idioms**: Use the editor to adapt a general language pack to a specific region (e.g., UK English vs. US English).
- **Store Variation**: If you run multiple stores (e.g., B2B and B2C), you can use different labels for the same keys to suit the different audiences.

**Accuracy:**

- **Check Length**: Ensure your translated text isn't significantly longer than the original, as it might break your theme's layout.
- **Variable Preservation**: Be careful not to delete placeholders like `%s` in strings (e.g., `Showing %s to %s of %s`), as these are replaced by numbers dynamically.

**Hreflang & SEO**: Changing text via the Language Editor is SEO-friendly as it changes the actual HTML output that search engines crawl.

## Common Tasks

1

#### Changing "Add to Cart" to "Buy Now"

1. Navigate to **Design → Language Editor** and click **Add New**.
2. Select your **Store** and **Language**.
3. Set **Route** to `common/language` or the specific product route `product/product`.
4. Find the **Key** `button_cart`.
5. Enter "Buy Now" in the **Value** field and **Save**.

2

#### Customizing the Welcome Message

1. In the Language Editor, add a new entry.
2. Select **Route** `common/header`.
3. Find a key like `text_welcome` (if applicable to your theme) or similar.
4. Enter your custom greeting and **Save**.

## Warnings and Limitations

**Critical Warnings**

- **Placeholders**: Never remove or change the order of placeholders like `%s`, `%d`, or `{variable}`. These are required for the system to insert dynamic data.
- **HTML Tags**: Some strings allow HTML, others don't. Adding HTML to a string that doesn't expect it can break the page layout or cause security issues.
- **Cache**: After saving a translation, you may need to clear your theme and SASS cache in the admin dashboard (Developer Settings) to see the changes.
- **Update Persistence**: While Language Editor changes are update-safe, if an extension changes its internal "Key" names in a new version, your old override may stop working.

## Troubleshooting

**Changes Not Appearing**

**Problem: You saved a translation but the old text still shows.**

**Diagnostic Steps:**

1. **Cache Check**: Click the blue gear icon on the main Dashboard and clear both Theme and SASS cache.
2. **Route Check**: Ensure you selected the correct Route. Some text appears in multiple places (e.g., "Add to Cart" appears in `product/product`, `product/category`, and modules).
3. **Store Check**: Verify you are viewing the same store that you applied the override to.

**Quick Solutions:**

- Clear your browser cache.
- If using a 3rd-party theme, check if they have their own translation system or cache.

**Finding the Correct Key**

**Problem: There are too many keys in the dropdown and you can't find the right one.**

**Diagnostic Steps:**

1. **Search**: Use the browser's search function (Ctrl+F) within the Key dropdown to find the default text.
2. **File Inspection**: If you still can't find it, you may need to check the actual language file via FTP (e.g., `catalog/language/en-gb/checkout/checkout.php`) to see the key name.

**Quick Solutions:**

- Look for common prefixes: `text_` for labels, `button_` for buttons, `error_` for errors.
