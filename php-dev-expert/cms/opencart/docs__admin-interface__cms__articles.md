8. Click **Save**. The article will be published according to its status and store assignments.

### Organizing Articles with Topics

To improve content discoverability:

1. Create topics in **CMS → Topics** before or while creating articles.
2. Assign each article to a relevant topic in the **Data** tab.
3. Use topics to create category pages, navigation menus, or filtered article lists.
4. Consider creating a hierarchy of broad topics (e.g., "News", "Tutorials", "Product Updates").

### Managing Article Comments & Ratings

Articles support user comments and ratings:

1. Enable comments in **CMS → Comments** settings (if available).
2. Monitor and moderate comments from **CMS → Comments**.
3. Use the **Calculate Ratings** button to update article rating averages.

## Best Practices

**Content Creation Strategy**

**Engaging Blog Content**

- **Consistent Publishing**: Maintain a regular publishing schedule to keep customers engaged.
- **Quality over Quantity**: Focus on valuable, well‑researched content rather than frequent low‑quality posts.
- **Customer‑Centric Topics**: Write about topics that help customers use your products, solve problems, or learn something new.
- **Visual Appeal**: Use high‑quality images, videos, and formatting to make articles visually engaging.
- **Call‑to‑Action**: Include clear calls‑to‑action (e.g., product links, newsletter signups, comment prompts).

**SEO Optimization**

**Search Engine Visibility**

- **Keyword Research**: Identify relevant keywords before writing and incorporate them naturally.
- **Meta Tags**: Craft compelling meta titles and descriptions for each article.
- **Internal Linking**: Link to related articles, products, and categories within your content.
- **External Linking**: Link to authoritative sources when citing information.
- **Mobile‑Friendly**: Ensure articles display well on mobile devices (OpenCart themes are responsive).
- **Loading Speed**: Optimize images and avoid excessive media that slows page load.

**Multi‑Language & Multi‑Store Considerations**

**Global Content Management**

- **Complete Translations**: Provide full translations for all languages your store supports.
- **Store‑Specific Content**: Use store assignments to publish location‑specific or brand‑specific articles.
- **Consistent Brand Voice**: Maintain consistent tone and style across all languages and stores.
- **Localized Examples**: Use examples, currencies, and references relevant to each store's audience.

**Article Deletion Warning** ⚠️ Deleting an article will permanently remove all its content, comments, ratings, and SEO URLs. Consider disabling the article instead if you may need it later. Export important articles as backups before deletion.

## Troubleshooting

**Article not appearing on frontend blog**

**Visibility Issues**

- **Status Check**: Verify the article is **Enabled**.
- **Store Assignment**: Ensure the article is assigned to the current store (in multi‑store setups).
- **Topic Status**: If assigned to a topic, verify the topic is also enabled.
- **Date Restrictions**: Check if there are any publish date restrictions (if supported by extensions).
- **Cache**: Clear OpenCart cache to refresh content listings.

**SEO URL not working (404 error)**

**URL Configuration Issues**

- **Keyword Uniqueness**: Ensure the SEO keyword is unique per store and language.
- **Character Restrictions**: Keywords can only contain a‑z, 0‑9, hyphen, and underscore.
- **Length Limits**: Keywords must be 1‑64 characters.
- **SEO Extension**: Verify that SEO URLs are enabled in **System → Settings → Server**.
- **Server Rewrites**: Ensure your server supports URL rewrites (mod\_rewrite for Apache, proper Nginx configuration).

**Images not displaying in article content**

**Media Management Issues**

- **Image Paths**: Verify image paths are correct and files exist in the image directory.
- **Permissions**: Check file permissions for the image directory (should be 755 for directories, 644 for files).
- **Editor Issues**: Try re‑uploading the image through the WYSIWYG editor's image manager.
- **Browser Cache**: Clear your browser cache or test in a different browser/incognito mode.

**Cannot delete an article**

**Dependency Issues**

- **Comments**: The article may have associated comments that must be deleted first.
- **Layout Overrides**: Check if the article has layout overrides assigned (remove them first).
- **Database Constraints**: Rare database constraints may prevent deletion—check error logs.
- **Solution**: Disable the article instead, or delete comments and layout assignments before retrying.
