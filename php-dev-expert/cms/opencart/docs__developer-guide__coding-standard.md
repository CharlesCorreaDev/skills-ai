### File types & encoding

All PHP files with the exception of view/template files have the extension .php

All view/template files have the extension .twig

Line feeds are handled automatically by Git, the repo is managed using LF. When cloning all line feeds will be converted automatically to your native environment (CRLF for Windows, LF for Mac/Linux).

### PHP Tags

Short PHP opening tags and ASP tags are not supported. The characters should be lowercase.

`<?php`

All PHP files must include a closing tag for versions before 2.0. PHP files in and after 2.0 will no longer have a closing tag.

```

### PHP Coding Standards Fixer

Ensure your code adheres to the project's standards effortlessly by utilizing [PHP Coding Standards Fixer](https://github.com/PHP-CS-Fixer/PHP-CS-Fixer). The provided configuration allows for automatic code formatting.

If your IDE doesn't already integrate with php-cs-fixer, run it as a standalone tool:

Use the following command to apply code adjustments and align it with the project's Code Standard:

Integrating php-cs-fixer into your workflow ensures consistent code formatting, streamlining collaboration and maintaining a clean, standardized codebase.

### Static Code Analysis

To preempt common coding mistakes, the code undergoes thorough analysis with the [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) code analyzer. If your IDE does not have native integration with PHPStan, you can use it as a standalone tool:

Initiate the following command to analyze your code changes and identify any potential issues:

Leveraging PHPStan enhances code quality by detecting errors and inconsistencies early in the development process. This proactive approach aids in maintaining a robust and error-free codebase.
