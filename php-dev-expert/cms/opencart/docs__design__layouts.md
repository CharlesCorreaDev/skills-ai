Layouts in OpenCart 4 give you complete control over the structure of your store's pages. Each layout defines which modules appear in specific positions (like sidebars, headers, or content areas) and which store routes (URL patterns) use that layout. This powerful feature allows you to create unique page designs for different types of content.

## Default Layouts

OpenCart 4 includes several pre-defined layouts for common page types:

Layout Type

Typical Routes

Description

**Default**

`common/home`

Home page and general fallback layout

**Product**

`product/product`

Individual product pages

**Category**

`product/category`

Category listing pages

**Manufacturer**

`product/manufacturer`

Brand/brand listing pages

**Information**

`information/information`

Static content pages (About Us, Contact, etc.)

**Article**

`cms/article`

Blog/article pages (if CMS enabled)

**Topic**

`cms/topic`

Blog topic pages (if CMS enabled)

**Tip:** You can modify the default layouts or create entirely new layouts to match your design needs. The Default layout cannot be deleted but can be modified.

## Practical Example: Creating a Homepage Special Layout

Let's walk through creating a custom homepage layout from start to finish.

1

**Plan Your Layout**

Before creating the layout, decide what modules you want on your homepage:

- **Content Top:** Featured products slider
- **Content Bottom:** Latest products grid
- **Column Right:** Special offers banner
- **Column Left:** Category navigation

Sketch the layout to visualize module placement.

2

**Create the Layout**

1. Go to **Design → Layouts**
2. Click **Add New**
3. Enter Layout Name: "Homepage Special"
4. Add Route: Store: "Default Store", Route: `common/home`
5. Click **Save** to create the empty layout

3

**Add Modules to Positions**

- **Content Top:** Select "Featured" module, set sort order 0
- **Content Bottom:** Select "Latest" module, set sort order 0
- **Column Right:** Select "Banner" module (configured with special offers), set sort order 0
- **Column Left:** Select "Category" module, set sort order 0

Click **Add Module** for each, then **Save** the layout.

4

**Test the Layout**

1. Visit your store homepage
2. Verify all modules appear in correct positions
3. Check mobile responsiveness
4. Test different screen sizes

Adjust sort orders or module settings if needed.

**Success:** You've created a custom homepage layout that highlights featured products, shows latest arrivals, and provides navigation—all optimized for conversion.

### Integration with Other Features

**Multi-Store Support 🏪**

Layouts support multi-store configurations:

1. Create different layouts for different stores
2. Assign layouts to specific stores via the route configuration
3. Each store can have completely different page structures

**Module Management 🧩**

Layouts work with all OpenCart modules:

1. Install and configure modules in **Extensions → Modules**
2. Add configured modules to layouts in **Design → Layouts**
3. Each module instance can be placed in different positions across different layouts

**Template System Integration 🎨**

Layouts complement the template system:

1. Templates control the visual design (HTML/CSS)
2. Layouts control the module placement and page structure
3. Together they provide complete design control

## Best Practices

### Layout Strategy 🎯

1. **Start Simple:** Begin with the default layouts and modify as needed
2. **Consistent Structure:** Use similar module arrangements across similar page types
3. **Mobile-Friendly:** Consider how layouts appear on mobile devices
4. **Performance:** Limit the number of modules per page for faster loading

**Route Management** ⚠️

1. **Specific First:** More specific routes should be configured before general ones
2. **Avoid Conflicts:** Ensure routes don't overlap unintentionally
3. **Test Thoroughly:** Check all route patterns work as expected
4. **Document Routes:** Keep a list of custom routes for future reference

**Module Placement** 🛠️

1. **Logical Order:** Place modules in logical reading order (top to bottom, left to right)
2. **Visual Hierarchy:** Important modules should have higher visibility
3. **Balance:** Distribute modules evenly across positions
4. **Empty Positions:** Leave empty positions if not needed (they won't display)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Layout not applying to pages 🔍**

**Possible Causes:**

- Route pattern doesn't match the page URL
- Another layout has a more specific route match
- Layout is not assigned to the correct store

**Solution:** Check the route configuration and ensure it matches the page's route exactly.

**Cannot delete layout 🗑️**

**Possible Causes:**

- Layout is assigned as the default store layout
- Products, categories, or other entities are using the layout
- Permission restrictions

**Solution:**

1. Check if layout is the default in **System → Settings → Store**
2. Reassign entities to other layouts first
3. Verify user has permission to delete layouts

**Modules not appearing 📦**

**Possible Causes:**

- Module is disabled
- Module is not added to the layout
- Module position doesn't exist in the template
- Sort order conflict

**Solution:**

1. Check module status in **Extensions → Modules**
2. Verify module is added to the layout in correct position
3. Check template supports the position
4. Adjust sort order if modules overlap

**Layout conflicts between stores 🏪**

**Possible Causes:**

- Route-store combinations overlap
- Default layout conflicts with store-specific layouts

**Solution:** Review all route assignments and ensure each store-route combination is unique.

**Performance Considerations** ⚡

- Each additional module on a page increases load time
- Complex layouts with many route checks can slow down page routing
- Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed layouts
- Regularly review and remove unused layouts
