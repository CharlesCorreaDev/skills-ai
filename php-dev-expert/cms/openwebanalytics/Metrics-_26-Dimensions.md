## Notes

### Visit (a.k.a Session)

Different web analytics tools use different methodologies to track sessions. As a result it is important to understand how this metric is computed. For example, the OWA time-out period for a visit is 30 minutes, but this may not be the case with all web analytics tools. Many web analytics tools make the visit time-out period configurable.

A visit typically consists of one or more page views. However, in the case of sites where interaction consists solely of file downloads, streaming media, Flash, or other non-HTML content, a request for this content may or may not be defined as a “page” in a specific web analytics tool but could still be viewed as a valid request as part of a visit. The key is that interaction with the site is represented.

When performing analysis using this metric, be mindful of the dimensions that are being added across or else a summation could result in an inflated total. For example, visits can be summed across a dimension such as Entry Page because a visit only has one Entry Page. However, visits are not additive over other dimensions such as Page, because visits can be associated with views of multiple pages.

### Visit Duration

Most web analytics tools use the timestamp associated with the Page View or Event that starts and ends a Visit to calculate this metric.

The timestamp used to determine the end of a Visit may differ by tool. Some tools use the timestamp of the last Page View, while others use the timestamp of other Events such as clicks, video start, etc. OWA uses the timestamp of the last event (page view, action, etc.).

Also, because this metric is calculated using the timestamps of Events, actual time spent on the website after the last Event is usually not included in the total.

Consider this example: (time is in the HH:MM:SS format)

- Timestamp of first Event in Visit – Jan 19, 2014 15:05:21
- Timestamp of last Event in Visit – Jan 19, 2014 15:17:35
- Visit Duration = 12m 14s

### Unique Visitors

This metric relies on the assignment of a unique ID to visitors of your website or application. The most predominant method for storing this unique ID is via a persistent browser cookie, although implementations vary tracking client/sdk.

Authentication, either active or passive, is the most accurate way to track unique visitors. However, because most websites do not require a user login, the cookie-based "unique visitor" is often used as a proxy for a unique individual. The cookie-based measurement method can lead to inaccuracies due to cookie deletion, shared computers, and browsing from multiple browsers or devices.

When performing analysis using this metric, be mindful that a summation using this metrics across multiple dimensions will result in an inflated total. For more information please reference the “hotel problem” as described on Wikipedia.

To reduce confusion when web analytics and audience measurement tools are used together, some web analytics providers have renamed the Unique Visitors metric to “Unique Browsers.”

### Search Term

This dimension is often used in two contexts: “Traffic Sources” and “Site Searches” (internal searches that happen mid-session on the website).

In the context of traffic sources, this dimension is used to determine which search terms are driving browsers to visit the website from organic or paid search sources. When two or more searches drive the user back to the same website within the same visit/session, the last search term is typically attributed to the session. However, this varies by the traffic attribution model configured for use by the tracker code.

Analysts also use this dimension to identify high performing search terms that might be candidates to purchase as part of paid search programs.

Site Search terms are terms within the particular domain. For instance, a visitor on amazon.com performs a site search when they enter a term like “electric blankets” in the search box.

When analyzing Site Searches, this dimension is used to analyze what people are searching for within a website.
 
Google and other search engines have stopped including the search term in their referring URLs when the search takes place under https protocol. In this case OWA will display the `(not provided)` label for the search term value.
