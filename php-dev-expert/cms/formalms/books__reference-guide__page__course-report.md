# Course Report

## Overview

The **Course Report Module** extends Forma LMS reporting capabilities by centralizing all course-related tracking data into a single, cohesive view. It enables administrators and trainers to analyze user progress, completion status, and performance at both course and participant level, supporting more informed decision-making. Built on the platform’s flexible reporting system, it allows customizable filters, detailed data selection, and export options. This module is designed to simplify monitoring course activities and improve the efficiency of training evaluation processes.

### Upgrading from Forma 4.1.x

This module has been introduced with Forma LMS 4.2. If you are upgrading from older forma versions, this single module will replace all the following teacher area features:

- [Gradebook](books__reference-guide__page__gradebook.md)
- [User Stats](books__reference-guide__page__course-stats.md)
- [Learning Objects Stats](books__reference-guide__page__course-stats.md)
- [Usage Stats](books__reference-guide__page__course-stats.md)
- [User/Objects Grid](books__reference-guide__page__userobjects-grid.md)

During the upgrade process all these features will be automatically removed both from the course menus and from the menu templates in admin area. A link to the new module will be automatically created in the same menu area both for course menu and menu templates. trying to migrate the same menu permission for administrative roles as the old modules.

Permissions eventually set to users enrolled with the role of student, ghost or guest will be removed.

Check your menus item after upgrade. In case the new module is not present in a course, **just re-apply to the course the menu template**, making permissions changes if needed. View the [menu management documentation](books__reference-guide__page__manage-menu.md) for details.
