Main settings for user related configurations:  from this section, it is possible to edit:

### Password

Main settings for password related configurations

### Register

Settings for platform registration modes and features

#### Registration Types

**Free self registration**
:   Users can self-register directly to the platform, receiving just their credentials if a notification event is enabled (Check [Event Manager](books__reference-guide__page__event-manager.md) for notification settings)

**Free registration with double OPT-IN**
:   Users will receive an email with a confirmation link upon self-registration

**Moderated self registration**
:   User registration must be approved by an administrator

**Only administrators**
:   Only administrators can register new users. Registration link on login page is disabled

#### Advanced Registration

Select the option “Use advanced registration form” to:

1. **Split registration for custom fields**: users will be asked first to fill the main registration fields, while all the custom fields will be prompted on a following page
2. **Enable self registration to Groups**: upon registration, users will be prompted with a list of groups and will be automatically added to the selected groups

#### Registration Code Usage

This feature extends the registration form, asking the user to select or insert a code.

This will:

- automatically insert the user in an orgchart node
- automatically enroll the registering user to some course
- both of the above

#### Other Options

    ### General Settings

    **Home Page**
    :   Select the page to be shown to users after login

    **Send user to catalog if not enrolled**
    :   Redirect user to catalog if MyCourses page is set as home page but is empty

    **Hide Empty category**
    :   In the catalog page, empty categories are not listed in the side tree categories listing

    **Show login catalog**
    :   A button to the courses catalog will be shown on the login page
    :   **Exclude completed courses from the view "all open"**: in the MyCourses page, the "All Open" filter will hide course already completed by the users. Useful if you have too many courses and need to filter the completed ones for better bage browsing

    ### Ecommerce

    Settings for the ecommerce features. You just need to enter your PayPal account and, if you actually want to sell courses, unflag the “sandbox” option. The sandbox would be used to run tests without actually completing the transaction, obviously when you are ready to sell your courses you don't need a sandbox anymore.

    **Important:**if you want to use the ecommerce functions, you also have to do 2 more things

    - enable the course catalog
    - flag the “sell course” option when you create or edit your course, and put a price on it.

    ## Security Related

    This section was introduced with Forma 4.0

    [![settings-security.JPG](https://docs2.formalms.org/uploads/images/gallery/2024-11/scaled-1680-/settings-security.JPG)](https://docs2.formalms.org/uploads/images/gallery/2024-11/settings-security.JPG)

    The option "Security Related > **Keep a list of deleted users**" has been removed since Forma 4.2 and will be automatically active

    ## SMS

    This feature has been **REMOVED SINCE FORMA 4.0**

    You can also send SMS from Forma. We have an integration with the popular Skebby service. Just create an account with them (click on the button), purchase credit from them and fill the required fields with the account information you will receive from Skebby.

    Then you'll be able to send Forma notifications with an SMS instead of an email. Every automatic event can be configured with email or SMS from the event manager. For the manual communications, you can decide what to use from time to time.

    Of course, you need to have the mobile phone number of your users in an additional field, and you need to set the correct field for the mobile number in this section.
