An example of this is the [User validation by e-mail](plugins__uservalidationbyemail.md) plugin which doesn’t allow users onto the website until their e-mail address
is validated.

## [Require admin validation](#id2)[](#require-admin-validation "Permalink to this heading")

In the Site settings under the Users section there is a setting which can be enabled to require admin validation of a new user account before
