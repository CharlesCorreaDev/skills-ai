# Cron[](#cron "Permalink to this heading")

If you setup cron correctly as described in [Cron](admin__cron.md)
special events will be triggered so you can register for these events from your own code.

The example below registers a function for the daily cron.

```
function my_plugin_init() {
    elgg_register_event_handler('cron', 'daily', 'my_plugin_cron_handler');
}
```

If timing is important in your cron event be advised that the functions
are executed in order of registration. This could mean that your function may
start (a lot) later then you may have expected. However the parameters provided
in the event contain the original starting time of the cron, so you can always use that
information.

```
function my_plugin_cron_handler(\Elgg\Event $event) {
    $start_time = $event->getParam('time');
}
```

## Custom intervals[](#custom-intervals "Permalink to this heading")

Plugin developers can configure there own custom intervals.

Warning

It’s **NOT** recommended to do this, as the users of your plugin may also need to configure your custom interval.
Try to work with the default intervals. If you only need to do a certain task at for example 16:30 you can use the `halfhour`
interval and check that `date('G', $start_time) == 16` and `date('i', $start_time) == 30`

```
elgg_register_event_handler('cron:intervals', 'system', 'my_custom_cron_interval');

function my_custom_cron_interval(\Elgg\Event $event) {
        $cron_intervals = $event->getValue();

        // add custom interval
        $cron_intervals['my_custom_interval'] = '30 16 * * *'; // every day at 16:30 hours

        return $cron_intervals;
}
```
