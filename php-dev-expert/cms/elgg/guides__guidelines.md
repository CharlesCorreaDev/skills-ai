# Plugin coding guidelines[](#plugin-coding-guidelines "Permalink to this heading")

In addition to the Elgg Coding Standards, these are guidelines for creating plugins.
Core plugins are being updated to this format and all plugin authors should follow
these guidelines in their own plugins.

Be sure to follow the [Plugin skeleton](guides__plugins__plugin-skeleton.md) for your plugin’s layout.

## [Use standardized routing with page handlers](#id1)[](#use-standardized-routing-with-page-handlers "Permalink to this heading")

- Example: Bookmarks plugin
- Page handlers should accept the following standard URLs:
  :   | Purpose | URL |
      | --- | --- |
      | All | page\_handler/all |
      | User | page\_handler/owner/<username> |
      | User friends’ | page\_handler/friends/<username> |
      | Single entity | page\_handler/view/<guid>/<title> |
      | Add | page\_handler/add/<container\_guid> |
      | Edit | page\_handler/edit/<guid> |
      | Group list | page\_handler/group/<guid>/owner |
- Include page handler scripts from the page handler. Almost every page handler should have a page handler script. (Example: `bookmarks/all` => `mod/bookmarks/views/default/resources/bookmarks/all.php`)
- Pass arguments like entity guids to the resource view via `$vars` in `elgg_view_resource()`.
- Call `elgg_gatekeeper()` and `elgg_admin_gatekeeper()` in the page handler function if required.
- The group URL should use views like `resources/groups/*.php` to render pages.
- Page handlers should not contain HTML.

## [Use standardized page handlers and scripts](#id2)[](#use-standardized-page-handlers-and-scripts "Permalink to this heading")

- Example: Bookmarks plugin
- Store page functionality in `mod/<plugin>/views/default/resources/<page_handler>/<page_name>.php`
- Use `elgg_view_resource('<page_handler>/<page_name>')` to render that.
- Use the default page layout in page handler scripts: `$content = elgg_view_layout('default', $options);`
- Page handler scripts should not contain HTML
- Call `elgg_push_entity_breadcrumbs()` or `elgg_push_collection_breadcrumbs()` in the page handler scripts.
- No need to worry about setting the page owner if the URLs are in the standardized format
- For group content, check the `container_guid` by using `elgg_get_page_owner_entity()`

## [The object/<subtype> view](#id3)[](#the-object-subtype-view "Permalink to this heading")

- Example: Bookmarks plugin
- Make sure there are views for `$vars['full_view'] == true` and `$vars['full_view'] == false`
- Check for the object in `$vars['entity']` . Use `elgg_instance_of()` to make sure it’s the type entity you want. Return `true` to short circuit the view if the entity is missing or wrong.
- Use the new list body and list metadata views to help format. You should use almost no markup in these views.
- Update action structure - Example: Bookmarks plugin.
- Namespace action files and action names (example: `mod/blog/actions/blog/save.php` => `action/blog/save`)
- Use the following action URLs:
  :   | Purpose | URL |
      | --- | --- |
      | Add | action/plugin/save |
      | Edit | action/plugin/save |
      | Delete | action/plugin/delete |
- Make the delete action accept `action/<handler>/delete?guid=<guid>` so the metadata entity menu has the correct URL by default

## [Actions](#id4)[](#actions "Permalink to this heading")

Actions are transient states to perform an action such as updating the database or sending a notification to a user. Used correctly, actions provide a level of access control and prevent against CSRF attacks.

Actions require action (CSRF) tokens to be submitted via GET/POST, but these are added automatically by elgg\_view\_form() and by using the `is_action` argument of the `output/url` view.

### Action best practices[](#action-best-practices "Permalink to this heading")

Action files are included within Elgg’s action system; like views, they are *not* regular scripts executable by users. Do not boot the Elgg core in your file and direct users to load it directly.

Because actions are time-sensitive they are not suitable for links in emails or other delayed notifications. An example of this would be invitations to join a group. The clean way to create an invitation link is to create a page handler for invitations and email that link to the user. It is then the page handler’s responsibility to create the action links for a user to join or ignore the invitation request.

Consider that actions may be submitted via XHR requests, not just links or form submissions.

## [Directly calling a file](#id5)[](#directly-calling-a-file "Permalink to this heading")

This is an easy one: **Don’t do it**. With the exception of 3rd party application integration, there is not a reason to directly call a file in mods directory.

## [Recommended](#id6)[](#recommended "Permalink to this heading")

These points are good ideas, but are not yet in the official guidelines. Following these suggestions will help to keep your plugin consistent with Elgg core.

- Update the widget views (see the blog or file widgets)
- Update the group profile ‘widget’ using blog or file plugins as example
- Update the forms
  :   - Move form bodies to `/forms/<handler>/<action>` to use Evan’s new `elgg_view_form()`
      - Use input views in form bodies rather than html
      - Add a function that prepares the form (see `mod/file/lib/file.php` for example)
      - Integrate sticky forms (see the file plugin’s upload action and form prepare function)
- Clean up CSS/HTML
  :   - Should be able to remove almost all CSS (look for patterns that can be moved into core if you need CSS)
- Use hyphens rather than underscores in classes/ids
- Do not use the `bundled` category with your plugins. That is for plugins distributed with Elgg
- Don’t use `register_shutdown_function` as you may not have access to certain Elgg parts anymore (eg database). Instead use the `shutdown` `system` event
