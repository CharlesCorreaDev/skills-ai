## Update InvoicePlane

1. **Make a backup of your database and all files!** This is very important to prevent any data loss.
2. Download the latest version from [InvoicePlane.com](https://invoiceplane.com/downloads).
3. Copy all files to the root directory of your InvoicePlane installation but **do not** overwrite the following files:
   - `/application/config/database.php`
   - Customized templates in `/application/views/`
4. Update the URL in the `/index.php` file.
5. Open `http://yourdomain.com/setup` and follow the instructions. The app will run all updates on
   it's own.
6. Login again and check if everything is working.
